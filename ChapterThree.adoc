== Chapter three - Why the structure works

In the previous chapter we described what the structure, the anatomy, of ALA looks like as if we were dissecting a dead body. We see where things are but we don't yet understand why they are there. In this chapter we explain why that structure works. Why does this way of organising code result in software that meets those non-functional requirements we listed in Chapter one?

The organisation of this chapter (and all chapters) is to use different perspectives. We all have different prior knowledge on which we build new knowledge, so we will each have a different best way to understand things. Use the perspective that makes the most sense to you. Because of the use of perspectives, there will often be some repetition of ideas between the major sections. 


=== A thought experiment

Imagine you are reading the following function, abc123, and trying to understand it:

 float abc123(float[])
 {
     ...
     b = xyz789(a)
     ...
 }

 float xyz789(float)
 {
     ....
     // complicated code
     ....
 }

You don't know what abc123 nor xyz789 do. They may as well be called fubar (fubar stands for \******ed up beyond all recognition), so you follow the indirection, an inconvenience at the least because you are really just wanting to understand abc123. You have to mentally stack where you were in the code of abc123, including everything you understand about it so far. 

You begin reading the code in xyz789. It only has about 20 lines but it is complicated. You need to use the code in abc123 to try to unravel what xyz789 might be providing to it. A comment mentions that it uses a CORDIC algorithm and gives a reference. But before following that indirection as well, you note that both abc123 and xyz789 have the following properties:

* they are modules
* apparently loosely coupled 
* have a simple interface
* use encapsulation of internals
* use no external variables
* have no side effects
* hide information
* probably separate two concerns
* are small
* follow coding guidelines
* have comments

Despite having all these great properties, still we are forced to read both functions to understand the code in either of them. They are effectively fully coupled - understanding any of the code involves understanding all of the code.  

Now we make a small change: 


 float StandardDeviation(float[])
 {
     ...
     b = Sqrt(a)
     ...
 }

 float Sqrt(float)
 {
     // complicated code
 }

Suddenly understandability is absolutely transformed. All we did was make the two functions abstractions. Now we don't have to read the complicated code inside xyz123 at all. The code inside each of the two functions goes from highly mutually coupled to zero coupled. 

All those other attributes that we listed above seemingly made no difference. The quality attribute that really mattered was abstraction. The others are still good to have, but they are completely insufficient. The abstraction property is _the_ one that our brains have evolved to use.

The quality of abstraction is subjective. Software engineers must invent good quality abstractions. No compiler or tool can yet check that quality.

* In the downward direction, coupling goes to zero because the standard deviation function need only know the concept of the squareroot abstraction.

* In the upward direction, coupling goes to zero because squareroot is more abstract and therefore can't know anything about the more specific Standard deviation abstraction that happens to use it. 

There are other benefits too:

* Abstraction and stability go hand in hand. The Sqrt abstraction is as stable as the concept of squareroot. That's a concept that's been stable for thousands of years. All dependencies in an ALA program go in the direction of the more stable.  

* Abstraction and reuse go hand in hand (as pointed out by Krueger). The more abstract an abstraction is the more reusable. Code reuse in ALA programs increases markedly.  

The complicated code inside SQRT no longer matters. It is completely isolated by the abstraction. If your brain already knows the SQRT concept (I had to choose one that everyone knows), there is no need to follow the indirection when reading the code inside StandardDeviation. The reader just continues reading the next line of code after the Sqrt invocation as if Sqrt is just like any other line of code in their base language. That's what abstraction is.



With this new understanding, we will now define the word dependency to be compile-time relationships, and coupling to be the design-time. One is what the compiler sees, the other is what our brain sees. 

Using these definitions, you can have coupling without dependencies (sometimes called implicit coupling). The reverse is also true - it is possible to have dependencies without coupling. ALA makes use of this by simply making a constraint that all dependencies must be on abstractions. When you do that, every artefact (abstraction) in the program is zero-coupled with every other. 

Doing this isn't always easy because unfortunately there are many established architectural methods, patterns and styles that break this constraint. On the other hand, applying this constrain emerges some patterns that we will immediately recognise. DSLs and dependency injection are two examples. We will also emerge some less well known ones that are none-the-less not novel. There already exists an "abstract interactions" pattern, for example, which uses interfaces that are more abstract than the modules using it.


There are two situations that commonly cause coupling in conventional code:

. In the above example, imagine that def456 is just a source or destination for messages (in the same abstraction layer as abc123) such as a display. Then abc123 cannot be an abstraction because it cannot be reused without dragging def456 with it. If abc123 is an abstraction, it cannot know (or care) where the data comes from or goes to. To fix this, def456 must be passed into abc123 by something else above both of them. In other words, they must be composed. This can be passing in a function, passing in an object (dependency injection), or other mechanism such as function composition, monad composition, or the WireTo operator that we will use a lot in our ALA example projects.
+
In conventional code, if abc123 calls directly def456, then the connection relationship between abc123 and def456 is hidden inside abc123. In ALA that relationship has to be an explicit line of code (inside another abstraction) in the layer above that composes the two instances. There, it will be cohesive with other similar relationships that work together in a collaborative way to make the application. 
+
Often these collected together wirings form a graph, making diagrams rather than code an even better way to describe the application.

. In conventional code, if xyz789 provides a part of the implementation of abc123, it will be more specific than abc123. Sometimes such a function or class is called a helper or submodule because xyz789 could only ever be used by abc123. In ALA xyz789 needs to be significantly more abstract than abc123 or it will be highly coupled to it. If xyz789 is put inside abc123 the complexity inside abc123 is still that of both of abc123 and xyz789 together.
+
This is contrary to what we are taught. We are taught to "divide and conquer" or to separate out the responsibilities. If we do this arbitrarily, we will end up with specific pieces (such as UI and business logic) which are highly coupled with each other, and with the specific application. We need to work hard to separate only by finding abstractions - potentially reusable artefacts. Then we configure instances of those abstractions for each specific use by passing the application specific details into them.  

In summary, ALA's starting premise is a constraint. The constraint is that you can only use one type of dependency - a dependency on an abstraction that is significantly more abstract than the one using it. This results in zero coupling throughout the abstractions of the entire program. 


=== Abstractions

==== Design-time encapsulation

[IMPORTANT]
====
[green]#*Abstractions*# are the human brain's version of [green]#*encapsulation*#.
====

The maintainability quality attribute is often thought of in terms of ripple effects of change. I don't think that is quite the right way to look at it. I have often had to make changes across a number of modules in poorly written code. The changes themselves just don't take that long. The problem I see is the time you have to spend understanding enough of the system to know where to make a change, even if it ends up being just one line of code in one place. To make that small change with confidence that it wont break anything can take a long time understanding the collaboration between modules. You may have had to understand a lot of code to figure that out. You have to understand all the code that is potentially coupled to that one line of code, which is essentially the complexity.

Unlike encapsulation which works at compile-time, abstractions hide complexity at design-time. They give boundaries to how far you have to read code to understand it.



==== Abstractions and Instances

[IMPORTANT]
====
[green]#*Software architecture*# should contain [green]#*two concepts*# for its [green]#*elements*#  equivalent to [green]#*abstractions*# and [green]#*instances*#.
====

If you are going to have abstraction, it makes sense that you would have instances. 
An instance is nothing more than the use of an abstraction by referring to its name. If your abstraction is a pure function, then an instance is just using the function, or getting a reference to it.

If your abstraction is a class, and if that class contains data, then you need to instantiate the class so that each instance has its own data. Object oriented languages of course already have these two concepts as classes and objects. 

Many discussions on software architecture seem to combine them into one term, such as modules or components. These terms may implicitly contain the separate concepts of abstractions and instances, or they may be intended to only one instance. Not having explicit terms, like class and object, will inevitably lead to confusion. In ALA the terms we use are abstractions and instances.

The problem is that when we become vague about the difference between abstraction and instance, we will then create dependencies between abstractions, such as to get or put data. If you create dependencies between peer abstractions, they are no longer abstractions. Instead you need to wire the instances. If we don't have two separate and clear terms for abstractions and instances, we will end up with no abstractions. Many architectural styles appear to have this problem.

A common example of the problem is the UML, which already has the separate concepts of classes and objects. The UML class diagram encourages us to create associations between classes, destroying them as abstractions. The most important potential idea that OOP brought us was the idea of classes as reusable abstractions, and objects as their instances. It never happened in part because of the UML class diagram, and the very harmful habit of putting dependencies between abstractions instead of wiring instances. 

****
The quality of an abstraction's _concept_ or _idea_ is important. It is the existence of the concept that allows the brain to learn it and not have to know how it's implemented each time it comes across it. It is the concept of the abstraction that blocks coupling. ALA sometimes requires effort over several days to conceive good abstractions, especially for the first application in a new domain.

=== Zero coupling and higher cohesion

==== Zero coupling

****
Larry Constantine, who coined the expression "loose coupling and high cohesion" wrote: "The key question is: How much of one module must be known in order to understand another module?". That is the essence of the most useful way to think about coupling in software.
****

ALA has mutual zero coupling between the code inside (or the code that implements) all abstractions. This is the case both horizontally between peers in the same layer, and vertically up or down the layers. 

In software design we are only interested in design-time coupling. This means that to understand one piece of code, how much do we need to know about other pieces of code? It is about knowledge, which is about design-time. This is the coupling that matters. We will use the word coupling to refer to design-time coupling. 

Here is a typical definition of Loose coupling from the internet: "*Loose coupling* refers to minimal dependencies between modules, accomplished through strict, narrow, stable interfaces at the boundaries." 

This definition of loose coupling differs from ALAs in two respects.

Firstly, we are not minimizing dependencies. We are elliminating bad dependencies and maximizing good dependencies.

Secondly, it's not just about using interfaces. A lot of design-time coupling is what I call _collaboration coupling_. An interfaces between two modules that have a fixed arrangement with each other may hide some details, but it doesn't stop fundamental collaboration between the two modules. When modules have a fixed arrangement with each other, they are highly likely to be collaborating, and this collaboration will tend to increase during maintenance.  

Larry Constantine's key question about coupling (quoted above) is what is important. His reasoning came from identifying how to reduce complexity, the time taken to understand software, and reducing the incidence of bugs. Some definitions of coupling are in terms of the ripple effects of change. This is part of it, but even if a change ends up being made in one place, the time taken to understand all the collaborating code can be severe.

Wikipedia defines coupling as "the degree of interdependence between software modules". It doesn't really distinguish between design-time, compile-time or run-time coupling, and the given formula for coupling seems to reflect compile-time. I prefer to think of coupling as a design-time property. It is about knowledge of internals of a module. The use of abstractions instead of modules allows us to achieve zero coupling.

Consider the principle of compositionality. As stated in Wikipedia, "In semantics, mathematical logic and related disciplines, the principle of compositionality is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them." In ALA we use domain abstractions as the 'constituent expressions', and programming paradigms as the 'rules used to combine them'. We have the objective that all code conforms to the principle of compositionality. We can then define coupling as anything that compromises this principle.

[TIP]
====
[green]#*To understand any one part of the code should involve understanding only that one part of the code, and the abstractions it uses.*#
====

Unfortunately there is a meme in the software engineering industry that there must be some coupling between 'modules'. The argument goes that if the system is to do anything it must have some coupling between its parts. We therefore hear of "loose coupling" as being the ideal. Using the definition of coupling given above, this is completely incorrect. Because of this meme, in conventional code we have developed a habit of using dependencies to implement communications. We are settling for design-time coupling to achieve run-time communication connections between different parts of a system. This is not necessary. Part of the problem is that the same word, _coupling_, is being used for both design-time coupling and _connections_ or _wiring_ used for communications. 

In our A & B example above, the code inside B knows nothing of A. The code inside A, while it knows about the concept of the abstraction B, knows nothing about the code that is inside B. So it's not like we don't know how to do zero-coupling. ALA is basically a constraint to force us to _always_ do zero coupling.

For example, in conventional code, if function Switch calls function Light, the code inside Switch is coupled with Light. If the light's abstraction level is about the same as that of the Switch, then the abstraction of Switch is destroyed. When you reuse it you have to know the internal code brings in a Light. To understand the _system_ (a Switch connected to a light), you have to go inside the Switch:


[plantuml,file="switch-light-bad.png"]

digraph foo {

#[ style = invis ];
}
B [label="Light"; shape = rect; style=rounded ]
A -> B [dir="both", arrowhead="open", arrowtail="tee", color=red, label=""]
}
@enddot
----


If instead, an abstraction, System, has code inside it like Light(Switch()), then Switch remains a good abstraction whose internal code is now only concerned with how a switch works. The code inside all three abstractions is now zero coupled. Understanding the system no longer requires looking inside Switch.  

[plantuml,file="diagram-collaboration-A-B-C.png"]

----
@startdot
digraph foo {

}
@enddot
----




A similar argument applies if Switch and Light are classes. In conventional code they will commonly have an association relationship. Even if Light is injected into Switch by a higher entity called System, Switch still knows the specific interface of a light (LightOn(), LightOff()). This interface is not abstract enough to prevent Switch knowing about Light, and Switch knowing about the System. If you instead have a class System that has code like new Switch().WireTo(new Light()) using a generic interface then all three abstractions are zero coupled.

ALA _never_ uses coupling for connections or wiring between parts of a system. A larger system typically consists of many  connections. These connection are typically cohesive, and belong in one place. In conventional code they tend to be distributed and buried inside the modules. A smell is that you are doing 'all files' searches to unravel them   


==== Cohesion


[TIP]
====
"[red]#*Collaboration*# becomes [green]#*cohesion*#".
====

In ALA, collaboration between modules becomes cohesion inside a new abstraction. A call from one module to another becomes a line of code. Calloboration between a group of modules for a single purpose, such as a user story, becomes several cohesive lines of code.

Cohesion also increases in a different way. An abstraction is closely aligned with the single responsibility principle. We can think of abstraction as a single concept principle. Using abstractions increases the cohesion of the code that implements the abstraction.

ALA provides no structure for the internals of an abstraction because the code is cohesive. The internals of an abstraction could be described as a small ball of mud, which is why they should be small. There is no such thing as a sub-abstraction. Instead the code is composed of instances of abstractions from lower layers. So layers replace hierarchical encapsulation. 
Zero coupling and high cohesion limits ripple effects of change, whether in higher layers or lower ones. A ripple stops at an abstraction concept because of the inherent stability of the concept itself.

What does happen though is that abstractions can be improved as abstractions. Often you can generalize an abstraction to make it more reusable by adding a configuration that has a default behaviour, so it doesn't affect other uses of the abstraction (convention over configuration).

In our experience, the most common type of change that still affects multiple abstractions are changes to conventions. Conventions in the ways abstractions are commented, and their code laid out are effectively abstractions in themselves that live in the bottom layer. So when they change, it makes sense that all abstractions that depend on them change. These conventions will mature in time. Besides, while these types of changes may require a lot of editing, they don't require simultaneous understanding of multiple modules, which is where the real problem with coupling lies. 





=== Good versus bad dependencies

For the purposes of this book, a dependency is when some code symbolically refers to a class, interface or function or other artefact in a separate piece of code. This covers everything from dependencies on classes, interfaces, modules or components, to dependencies on libraries or packages. 

A dependency can be on something inside a class or interface, usually a method or property. Even if using an object reference, there is still a dependency if there is a reference to something named inside the class or interface. 

We can distinguish between good and bad dependencies. Good dependencies are  design-time dependencies. These are dependencies on the knowledge you must have to even understand a given piece of code. I will often refer to this type as a "knowledge dependency" or "use of an abstraction". It is also sometimes called "semantic coupling". This type of dependency effectively adds to the language you use to write code. Here is a diagram shwoing a good dependency.

}
B [label="MoreAbstract"; shape = rect; style=rounded ]
A -> B [dir="both", arrowhead="open", arrowtail="tee", color=green, label=""]
}

A bad dependency is one that is there to facilitate run-time communications between two modules or components. Here is a diagram representation.

A -> B [dir="both", arrowhead="open", arrowtail="tee", color=red, label=""]
}
@enddot

Another type of bad dependency is when a module uses a submodule that is a specific part of it. An example is a 'helper' class. The submodule is often thought of as being logically contained inside its parent module.

A simple example of a communication dependency is a module that calculates the average then calls a display module to display the result. To understand the code that calculates the average requires no knowledge about displays, nor even where the result will be sent. So it is a bad dependency.

The intention of the fixed arrangment between Average and Display was to measure rainfall. To do that, an instance of an Average module needs to be connected to an instance of Display module at run-time, but you don't need a dependency to achieve that.

A simple example of knowledge dependencies occurs in an abstraction that measures rainfall. To understand the rainfall code, you must understand the concepts of average and of display. The rainfall abstraction can use the abstractions for averaging and displaying. 



We typically find both good and bad dependencies in conventional code. A typical modular program is full of bad dependencies. But whether a knowledge dependency or a communication dependency, they all look syntactically the same - a function call or a 'new' keyword, etc. We are not gnerally taught how to distinguish between them. We lump them together when we talk about dependency management, loose coupling, layering, fan-in, fan-out, circular dependencies or dependency inversion. Dependency graphing tools cannot distinguish between them because identiying good dependencies would require understanding abstraction levels. 

Good and bad dependencies are not just good and bad. They are really good and really bad.

A knowledge dependency is good because it's only a dependency on an abstract concept, on something stable and learnable. We want more of them, because then we are reusing our abstractions. Then the more dependencies you have on such an abstraction, the more abstract it is. 

So it's doubly important that we are able to tell good dependencies from bad. 

It's entirely possible to build a system using only good dependencies. 

[TIP]
====
[green]#*In ALA we eliminate ALL bad dependencies*#.
====


Bad dependencies destroy abstractions. They cause explicit and implicit coupling. They obscure the structure of the application by distributing that structure throughout its modules.

When we remove all bad dependencies, they become normal lines of code, cohesive with one another, inside a more specific abstraction in a higher layer. Each line of code composes instances of the abstractions which would otherwise have had the bad dependency.

Consider the diagram below. It's the conventional modular way to write a rainfall meter. An ADC reading is averaged, converted, accumulated, and displayed. The middle three modules have bad dependencies which they use to make function calls to pull data in and push data out.

There are five good dependencies from the Application to the five Abstractions. There are also five good dependencies from the Abstraction on Dataflow. We never draw arrows on a diagram for good dependencies. Instead we just refer to the abstractions by name.

Connections between the instances of teh abstractions are completely described inside the Application. There it is cohesive code that knows about how to build a rain meter.

The code in the application abstraction could look something like this if using functions (although you would likely use some temporary variables in practice):

[source,C#]
....
    Disp(Accu(Conv(Avg(ADC()))));
....

It might look something like this if using classes:


[source,C#]
....
    new ADC().WireIn(new Avg()).WireIn(new Conv()).WireIn(new Accu()).WireIn(new Disp());
....

How this code is done is not what's important. How syntactically succinct this code is is not important. What's important is where it is. We want the code that cohesively and fully expresses a rain meter to be in one place.  

The lower-case letters used in the top layer of the diagram represent instances of the respective abstractions. (In UML they would be underlined.) 

You never draw arrows for knowledge dependencies - you only ever refer to abstractions by name. (Just as you would never draw an arrow to a box representing the squareroot function - you would just use Sqrt by its name.)

In common programming languages, the communication dependencies in the first diagram and the knowledge dependencies in the second diagram could both be syntactically written in the same form, either new A() or just a function call, A(). The only difference is in where those new keywords or function calls are.

The application abstraction can move the data between the instances of ADC, Avg, etc itself, as we did in the first code example, however strictly speaking that pollutes it with details of how to move data that actually belongs in the programming paradigms layer. We much prefer the application code just does the composing - just specifies who connects to whom, but is not involved with how data actually flows. That's why in most of the examples, we compose with classes that have ports rather than functions. In the second code example, the dataflow programming paradigm would be implemented with an execution model that knows how to actually move data. The application only knows that it is composing a flow of data.

The interface used to connect the instances is called Dataflow. It's important that this interface is abstract. It is two layers down. It is not an interface specific to any one of the domain abstractions, ADC, Avg, etc. This is the abstract interactions pattern. Other domain abstractions can either implement it or accept it, or both.


==== Comparison of good versus bad dependencies.


.Comparison of two approaches
[width="100%",options="header,footer"]
|====================

| Run-time dependencies version | Knowledge dependencies version

| Knowledge about the specific application is spread through all modules. | Knowledge about the specific application is only in one place. The abstractions know nothing of each other or the specific application. 

| The class or function names A, B, D and E will relate to what they do (which is fine). For example, they may be the specific hardware chips used in the case of drivers. The calling module must know these names, creating a fixed arrangement between the modules. The modules are only loosely coupled. | No abstractions refer to the names of peer abstractions. There is no fixed arrangement between abstractions. The abstractions are zero coupled. The code that knows that a particular hardware chip is used in this application is where it belongs, in the application abstraction.

| Since there is a fixed arrangement, responsibilities can be blurred. For example, it may be unclear whether to add something to B or C. | With no relations between abstractions, responsibilities are clear. Something to be added clearly belongs in one or other of the abstractions, or in a new abstraction that may be wired in between the two.

| The fixed dependency from C to B will encourage implicit coupling. B can make assumptions about details inside B resulting in collaborative coupling. | C cannot make any assumptions about some details of B. It cannot have collaborative coupling with B 

| Although there is no dependency, for example from B to C, the fixed arrangement is likely, over time, to make B implicitly collaborate with C (do what C requires), resulting in collaborative coupling. | No implicit coupling can develop over time because there is no fixed relationship between them. B cannot collaborate with C (do what C specifically requires).

| The arrangement between A, B, C, D and E is not obvious in the code. It is buried inside of B, C and D. All must be read to find the application's dataflow structure | The arrangement between instances of A, B, C, D and E is explicitly coded in one place. The dataflow between them is cohesive information that belongs in one place.

| Only A and E can potentially be abstractions. | All of A, B, C, D and E are abstractions.

| Arbitrarily, only the two ends of the dataflow chain can be reused independently . | All of A, B, C, D and E are independently reusable.

| Difficult to insert another module between, say, B and C. | Easy to insert a new instance of some operator between B and C, etc. 

| If the observer pattern is used (in the mistaken belief that it reduces the coupling), it only mirrors the same problems. For example B would now have a dependency on C when it registers. But because it adds indirection, the observer pattern makes the program even harder to understand. | If the observer pattern is used (as the means to implement the wiring between the instances), the receivers do not do the registering, the application does (not strictly the observer pattern). The abstractions themselves don't get more difficult to understand because, being abstractions, they only have knowledge as far as their interfaces anyway. The application does not get harder to understand either, because the arrangement of the instances is still explicit and in one place.

| If dependency injection is used with automatic wiring, the arrangement is still somewhat fixed, but is now even more obscure. All classes can still be collaborating with one another. A smell that this is happening is that over time the interfaces, IA, IB, ID and IE change as the requirements of the system change.  | If dependency injection is used, the application does the wiring explicitly. It is the only place that should know who will talk to whom at run-time for this specific application. There are no specific interfaces between pairs of modules to change over time, because they all just use a stable abstract interface.  

| Each module has its own interface. But they are all doing essentially the same thing, getting data. | Uses a single more abstract interface called Dataflow.  

| The arrangement between the modules cannot easily be changed, both because the wiring code is buried inside the modules and because the interfaces are essentially specific to pairs of modules. | The composition can easily be changed. Instances of the abstractions can be re-wired in any combination. New abstraction instances can be inserted.

| There is no diagram of the arrangement between A, B, C, D, E, or if there is, it is likely a high level overview, lacking in detail, and a second source of truth that gets out of date. | There is a diagram that shows the arrangement of the instances of A, B, C, D and E. It is the one source of truth. It includes all details about the specific application. It is executable.
|====================


During code creation, run-time dependencies are easily introduced, and never seem too terrible at the time as they get the immediate job done. But when they accumulate to hundreds or even thousands of them, as they do in most typical applications, that's when the system, as described on the left side of the table, just appears as a monolithic big ball of mud.

==== Free lunch?

When you are comparing the left and right sides of the table above, you may be wondering, where did the free lunch come from? Where did the runtime dependencies go? Is this some kind of magic? Or how can the program work without them? Or haven't I just moved them somewhere else? No there are no tricks. The answer is that we have been taught to do programming in a very bad way. The knowledge that ADC will talk to Avg, etc at run-time is there, but it is now contained within an abstraction, not a dependency between modules. If you really want to find a disadvantage, then it is the need for the abstractions. It only works as well as the quality of the abstractions. Effectively we have traded the need for dependency management, and all the complexity that bad dependencies cause, with the need to create good abstractions. Creating good abstractions is a skill that does take time to get used to.

Just to recap the only dependencies we have used are good design-time or knowledge dependencies: 

. The application should and must 'know' at design-time what domain abstractions it needs to compose to make a rain meter application.

. The domain abstractions should and must know at design-time what programming paradigm they need - the abstract interfaces to use for their input and output ports. 


==== Stable dependencies principle

A dependency on an abstractions is a dependency on the concept or idea of that abstraction. A concept or idea is generally stable. So dependencies are toward the more stable. 

Even if the implementation details inside an abstraction are complicated or change, the abstraction concept itself be stable. The application example above is really just depending on the idea of an ADC or the idea of a Display. If the details inside change it doesn't matter. For example, if the ADC silicon is changed, the ADC abstraction implementation can also change. But the application is still just using an ADC as it's means to get input. 

ALA therefore naturally conforms with the Stable Dependencies Principle (depend in the direction of stability). The SAP is mostly used in relation to packages, but ALA does not use hierarchical encapsulations. Here we are applying it at the level of the abstractions themselves.


==== Dependency fan-in and fan-out

One of the guidelines sometimes used for dependencies in conventional code is that a class that has high fan-in should not have high fan-out (also called afferent and efferent coupling). Another is that modules higher in the layers should have low fan-in and those lower in the hierarchy have low fan-out.

The argument goes that a class with high fan-in should have high stability but one with high fan-out would have low stability (presumably because dependencies are thought to be things that cause changes to propagate).

In ALA, dependencies are on abstractions. Furthermore the abstractions are increasingly abstract as you go down the layers, and therefore increasingly stable. Therefore the conventional fan-in and fan-out recommendations are reversed. In ALA, it is perfectly fine, in fact really good to have both high fan-in and high fan-out. It simply means that the abstractions are useful and are getting reused.  

If we are talking about dependencies in a conventional modular system that are used for communication between modules in the system, of course ALA says we want zero fan-in and zero fan-out, because such dependencies are illegal anyway.

In chapter four we will also talk about fan-in and fan-out. Note that the fan-in and fan-out discussed in chapter four is different. In this chapter fan-in and fan-out is talking about dependencies on abstractions between layers. In chapter four we are talking about fan-in and fan-out in the wiring.


==== Circular dependencies

Of course in ALA, with only knowledge dependencies present in the system, and the dependencies needing to go toward more abstract abstractions, you obviously cannot have circular knowledge dependencies. Nor would that even make sense. (Recursion appears to require circular knowledge dependencies but actually doesn't. We will visit that in the last chapter.) 

Since there are no run-time dependencies, the issue of circular dependencies with them does not arise at all. What might have been circular dependencies in conventional code becomes circular wiring of instances of abstractions inside a user story abstraction in the application layer. Such circular wiring is quite valid, and very common. The potential issues with the execution models are discussed in chapter four.

In conventional software design, run-time communication channels between modules are frequently implemented with dependencies. Then we realize these dependencies are a problem and so we add a rule that we don't like circular dependencies. This is an attempt to mitigate the problem by forcing the modules to have a sort of arbitrary layered structure. That structure does not actually exist in the nature of peer modules themselves. (Many modules will actually have a similar level of abstraction, for example views, business logic and data.) The forced arbitrary layering structure becomes its own nuisance.

So then what happens is circular dependencies are most often avoided by using pushing in one direction and pulling in the other. (Pushing means a function or method call with a parameter, pulling means a function or method call returning a value). This is sometimes actually convenient, and other times a real nuisance. Whether we push or pull should be able to depend on performance or other considerations (which end wants to initiate the communications, which depends on when the source changes, or when we want to receive new a the data, or how often the source changes, or on latency, etc), not on an arbitrary layering of modules.

So, when we do want to push or pull in the reverse direction of the allowed dependency, we end up creating an indirection, such as a callback, virtual function call, or observer pattern (publish-subscribe). This indirection further obscures the already  obscure communication flows through the system.

ALA simply eliminates all this nonsense. In ALA, communication flows:

* are explicit
* can be in both directions
* each set of cohesive flows are contained in one place
* allowed to be push, pull, or asynchronous on a port by port basis
* don't use dependencies at all
* use indirection in the correct way, which is that when you are reading code inside an abstraction, you don't know, and shouldn't know, where your inputs and outputs are wired to. 

That concludes our discussion on why the ALA structure works from the point of view of good and bad dependencies.



==== Knowledge dependencies are on all layers below

Sometimes layers are used incorrectly as partitions or really just modules. We would be better off to just tip all such layering models on their side.  Because of this mistake, there is a meme that we should only have dependencies on the immediate layer below. For ALA layers this is incorrect.

When we write our programs using only knowledge dependencies, the knowledge needed to understand a piece of code can come from all the layers below. 

For example, to understand this application layer code:

[source,C#]
....
    new ADC().WireIn(new Avg()).WireIn(new Conv()).WireIn(new Accu()).WireIn(new Disp());
....

You need to know all of these things from lower layers:

. Understand what the  domain abstractions, ADC, Avg, Disp, etc do.

. Understand the dataflow programming paradigm. When you compose these particular domain abstractions, you are composing a flow of data from left to right.

. Understand that the WireTo operator, which comes from the Libraries layer, is what you use to do composition. 

. Understand your general purpose programming language, which sits below the Libraries layer.

. Understand ALA which is an abstraction that sits below the programming language layer.

All of these knowledge dependencies should be explicit. This means that the application folder should contain a readme file explaining all these knowledge dependencies, and link to information about them.

It's nt necessarily the case that all lower layer knowledge is needed to understand something. The application is itself an abstraction. There can be many instances of it being used by different users. These users don't need to understand all the abstractions in all the layers, only the application abstraction by itself.



=== Executable expression of requirements

We have previously discussed this aspect of ALA in terms of structure. It is the top layer. And we have used this aspect as the starting point in the method to develop the example projects. But why does the succinct description of requirements in that top layer work?

In conventional software development, we typically break a user story (or feature or functional requirement) up into different implementation responsibilities. For example, layers like GUI, business logic and database, or a pattern such as MVC (Model, View, Controller). But a user story or feature actually starts out as cohesive knowledge n the requirements. And its not a huge amount of cohesive knowledge, so it doesn't need breaking up. Cohesive knowledge, knowledge that is by its nature highly coupled within itself should be kept together. All we need to do to keep it together is find a way to describe it so that it is executable. Don't try to do any implementation, just get it described in a concise and complete form. If you can do that, the chances are you will be able to find a way to make it execute. 

In ALA we want to find a way to express the user story with about the same level of expressiveness as when the user story was explained in English by the product owner. The language he used would have contained domain specific terms to enable him to explain it concisely. The same thing ought to be possible in the code. Anything that does not come directly from the requirements and starts to look like implementation detail is separated out. It comes out into abstractions. These abstractions typically contain knowledge of how user stories in general are implemented - how things can be displayed, how things can be saved, how data can be processed.

Many times, abstractions that know how to implement useful things for expressing user stories are not only reusable for user stories, but can be reusable for other applications. In other words, they are domain level abstractions. A typical user story might be composed of several of them, some to implement the user story's UI, some to implement the user story's business, and some to implement the user story's saving of data. A user story instantiates the abstractions, configures them with the specific knowledge from the requirement, and then wires them together.

Most maintenance is probably changing, adding or fixing user stories or features. When those features are described entirely in one place instead of distributed through a lot of modules, you have a direct understanding of how the user story is represented by code, and therefore of how to change it or fix it.

Of course application code makes heavy use, in fact is entirely composed of, instances of domain abstractions. When fixing a bug, it quickly becomes clear if the application code itself doesn't represent the requirements as intended, or one of the abstractions is not doing its job properly. Again the maintenance is easy.

==== The meaning of composition

Expressing user stories as a composition of domain abstractions, as discussed in the previous section, is all well and good, but it doesn't work without defining what composion means. That's where programming paradigm abstractions come in.

For example, many applications have displayed values or outputs that need to be updated 'live'. In conventional code, we often write imperative code to implement this live behaviour. The code repeatedly gets data from its source(s), does some manipulation on that data, and updates the output. This kind of code uses lots of bad dependencies. we really should have a programming paradigm for it. In ALA you think of it as a dataflow. Wiring together domain abstractions represents data flowing automatically. This programming paradigm is not new, of course, it appears in Unix's pipes and filters, functional programming, binding GUI display elements to a data source, LINQ, Reactive Extensions, Labview, function blocks, ladder logic, and countless other programming systems. Dataflows are often used on distributed systems because implementation over literal wires is naturally a dataflow. But the paradigm is just as applicable inside monolithic systems. What ALA does is make it easy and natural to implement dataflow yourself every time it is the best way to express requirements. We should never be writing imperative code when dataflow is what best expresses what we want to do. ALA makes it easy wire a linear chain of data manipulations. But it also makes it easy to wire up an arbitrary network of dataflows. 

The same idea applies to the event-driven programming paradigm. It is common these days for GUI elements such as buttons, menu items, etc to have event-driven output ports. But then we often just wire them to imperative methods with a dependency. In ALA you create input ports as well. For example all popup window abstractions such as file browsers, wizards, settings, navigable pages, etc have input ports. The main window has a close input port. Long running tasks that need to be told when to start have an input port. Then you can use the event-driven programming paradigm for composing instances of these types of domain abstractions. 

Another programming paradigm is building the UI. Building the UI by composing abstractions is common using conventional libraries these days. The meaning of composition is containing one UI element inside another. The composed UI structure is a tree. For example XAML does this using XML. I do not like the use of XML for this. What ALA brings is doing all composition in a consistent way. Wiring for the UI is done in the same way as the composition wiring for dataflow, or event-driven, or any other programming paradigm you care to use. That way a user story is fully and cohesively expressed inside its own abstraction.

==== Requirements are what's left when you factor out all implementation details

This is another way of thinking that comes to the same solution. As we know from the previous section, ALA requires you build your entire application factoring out all pieces of computing work into domain abstractions and programming paradigm abstractions. So what does the application that's left in the top layer look like? Well if everything abstract has been factored out, what remains must be details specific only to this application. Essentially these details equate with the requirements.

The application code becomes a formal re-expression of the requirements. There will be some information there that wasn't explicitly stated in the requirements, but they were requirements all the same. For example, it may not have been stated in the requirements that a number displayed on the UI should not change its value too frequently - it should be slow enough for a human to read successive values. A consequence of that requirement is that it should not contain noise that has a frequency higher than the display update rate. So the application will end up with an instance of a re-sampler abstraction and an instance of a filter abstraction wired into its dataflow before the display. The application will specify the re-sampling rate, and the filter bandwidth.


// section moved here from chapter 2
==== DSL - Domain Specific Languages 

anchor:DSL1[]

ALA's succinct expression of requirements discussed above is obviously a form of DSL (Domain Specific Language). Under the broader definition of a DSL, The domain abstractions and programming paradigms layers are a DSL. But ALA is not just a DSL. ALA is fundamentally about organising all code into small abstractions that are in layers that are increasing abstract. This constrains the organisation of code much more than simply implementing a DSL. 

ALA does not pursue the idea of an external DSL (a new syntax), nor even the syntactic elegance of DSLs. It doesn't try to move application development away from the developer to a requirements team as some DSLs can do. For example, you don't get a new language such as XAML to express UI structure. In fact, expressing the UI structure in ALA moves away from XML back to code. If moving away from code, ALA uses diagrams because they are more flexible and much more readable than XML. 

Seen as a DSL, in ALA you wire together plain old objects or functions while conforming to a grammar. The grammar comes from the 3rd layer programming paradigms and from which classes use which programming paradigm for ports. This grammar defines the rules for their composition.


=== Diagrams vs text

The fundamental rules of ALA don't prescribe the use of diagrams. But diagrams often emerge. So why do we often use a diagram instead of text in the application (top) layer of an ALA application?

It's because in any non-trivial program, there is structure inherent in the requirements that forms a graph. If you have UI that graph is a tree - still representable with indented text. But the UI must have connections. (These particular connections are often called bindings.) They need connections with data. They need connections with event handlers. These connections must be done symbolically if using text. The connections go further. There are connections to business logic and to some form of persistent data model, and from there to real databases or files. There are arbitrary connections for navigating around different pats of the UI. If text, most of these connections must be done symbolically. On the way, they may need to connect arbitrarily with things that process, reduce, or combine. There may be states involved, with arbitrary transitions needed between those states. There may be activities that have to happen in a prescribed time sequence, which by itself is representable as a linear instructions in text. But there are often loops or alternative routes through the sequence, which is representable as indented text. But then there is always some connection between the activities and some data or the outside world. If text, these connections must generally be done symbolically. 

All these connections are inherent in the requirements. Like or not, they form a graph. And this graph structure is somewhere in your code.

As we said, in text from, this graph needs to use at least some symbolic connections. That is, we can represent some of the graph with indenting and judicious use of anonymous functions or classes, but in general we will need to represent many of the connections by using names of variables, functions or objects.

This is bad enough. In fact this is already really, really bad compared with how the electronics guys do things.

But it gets much worse. In most conventional code, we take all these symbolic connections and distribute them evenly through the files/modules/classes/functions. Now the graph is totally obfuscated. The graph is highly cohesive. Why do we make it harder for ourselves by breaking it up?

But it gets much worse. Graphs have circles in them. There is nothing wrong with that, it's inherent in the connections in the requirements. But circles are at odds with dependency rules. So now what we do is break the cyclic dependencies using principles like dependency inversion or observer pattern. The connections don't go away. We just further obfuscated them. These connections are now done at run-time by code written somewhere else. This is the so called indirection problem.

What a mess we have got into!

ALA tells us how to fix this entire mess. It's really quite simple. ALA breaks up your application by factoring out abstractions. When you have done that to the maximum extent, what's left behind is nothing but the specifics of the requirements, including that (highly coherent) graph.

Now you can choose to go ahead and represent that graph in text in one place, using many symbolic connections, and you would already be way, way better off than how we write conventional code. But even better is to do what the electronics guys do, and just build the tools to handle the graphs as diagrams properly.

==== Diagrams and text are not equivalent


Diagrams and text are sometimes thought of as equivalent, as if they have a duality like waves and particles in physics. It is said to be a matter of personal preference which you use, and since graphical tools are hard to produce, why not use text? I do not agree with this. From the point of view of how our brain's work best, they are very different, and each is powerful at its own job.

Consider an electronics engineer who uses a schematic diagram. Ask him to design a circuit using text and he will just laugh at you. Electronics naturally has a network structure that is best viewed and reasoned about as a diagram. If you turn a diagram into a textual list of nodes and connections, the brain can no longer work with it directly. It is constantly interrupted to search for symbolic references when it should be free to just reason about the design. 

Most software naturally has an arbitrary network structure. Think about whenever you are working with legacy code - how often to you need to do "all files searches" or "find all references". And even those are foiled by indirections. Try designing or reasoning about a non-trivial state machine without using a diagram.

Text can readily be used to compose elements in a linear chain or sequence. It is excellent for telling stories. White space is the normal connector between the elements. Sometimes periods or other symbols are used instead. Text can also handle shallow tree structures, simply by using indenting. Compilers may use brackets, usually () or {}. Interestingly, the brackets work for the compiler, but not for the brain. The brain doesn't see them, it just sees the indenting. So I personally don't agree that Python's significant indenting is a mistake as many do. 

When the tree gets deep, the indenting is too deep for our brains to follow. So text is only suitable for linear structures and shallow trees. Structured programming and XAML are examples of tree structured code represented successfully in text.

Text becomes troublesome when there are arbitrary connections across the structure forming a graph. It must be done with matching names, labels or identifiers. Most imperative programs are actually not a tree structure because of the variables. They must be done with labels. Local variables in a small scope are not a problem. It only requires an editor that highlights all of them. For large scopes we end up spending too much time finding and trying to remember the connections, resorting to many all-files searches. It is a cumbersome way to try to reason about what is usually a reasonably simple structure when viewed as a diagram. 

(When we talk about labels, we are talking about labels that are used for connecting two or more points. These labels are not abstractions. References to the names of abstractions are absolutely fine, and we don't draw lines for them even if we are using a diagram. We always just use abstractions by their name.)

When we need to compose instances of abstractions in an arbitrary network structure, our brains work much better using a diagram. The brain can readily see and follow the lines between the instances of the abstractions. Unlike with text labels, the lines are anonymous, as they should be. When symbolic connections are used, the symbols themselves need an encapsulation scope. Lines don't need encapsulation. They quietly connect two point without any other code seeing a symbol.

Generally lines connect only two points or ports, but sometimes may connect three or more. To understand all places connected by a symbolic connection requires an all files search. To understand all places connected by lines, the brain just follows the lines instead.  The spacial positioning of elements is also something the brain readily remembers. So, diagrams can qualitatively do things that text simply cannot.

If lines connect a high number of ports, it starts to smell as if a new abstraction may be waiting to be discovered.

ALA does not require a diagram per se. It only requires abstraction layering, and it's quite possible for a user story to just consist of a linear sequence of abstracted operations. For example, a sequence of movements by a robot or a "Pipes and Filters" sequence of operations on data. However, ALA is a polyglot programming paradigm because user stories will generally combine multiple programming paradigms: UI, event-flows, dataflows, state machines, data schemas, etc. These aspects of a user story tend to be naturally interrelated (inherent in the requirements), which is what causes the resulting relationships among its instances of abstractions to be a graph. Diagrams, then, embrace the bringing together of all these different interrelationships of a user story in one cohesive place.   

==== No XML as code

If dependency injection is used to implement the wiring, I prefer not to use XML to specify the application. Firstly XML is not very readable. Secondly it only handles tree structures well, not networks, and it becomes more unreadable if the tree is deep. If you must use text for specifying wiring, use normal code. Represent the diagram as a tree as much as possible, and use indenting to represnet that tree. Any nodes that need cross connections should be saved in local variables. The cross connections can then be wired using the variables. You will see this done in many of the examples.

You are still better off with this code in one place than having it distributed inside your modules. But if a graph structure is inherent in the requirements, there is really no substitute for the readability of diagrams. In time there will be good tool support for ALA applications.


==== Diagramming tools

The ALA design process (which is describing your requirements and inventing the needed abstractions as you go) is an intense intellectual activity, especially the first time in a new domain. As well as expressing your user stories, you are inventing abstractions. You are inventing a set of domain abstractions and programming paradigms that will allow you to express all user stories with a finite number of them. It requires all your focus. I have found that hand drawing the diagram on paper is not good. The diagram quickly gets into a mess which requires redrawing, and that interrupts your design flow. I have found that a diagramming tool that constantly needs you to control the layout, such as Visio, is also not good.   

So until there is a better tool, I have been using Xmind because as a mind-mapping tool, it is designed to not get in your way as you are creating. It lays itself out as a tree structure, and then allows cross connections on the tree to be added using a key short-cut at the source and a mouse click at the destination node. It has its limitations, however I use some simple conventions to get around these. For example, I use '<' and '>' to represent input and output ports.

Furthermore, the tree structure allows easy hand translation of the diagram into indented, fluent style code. 

While Xmind allows you to be creative in the beginning (I couldn't imagine doing without it), it is far from ideal once the abstractions have matured, and you are just churning out user stories.

We use a simple tool that takes Xmind files and generates the code automatically.

And even more recently, we have in progress a purpose built graphical IDE for ALA. But it is not complete.

See the end of this chapter for an example project using Xmind.


// TBD review from here

....
Thoughts on the essentials of a diagramming tool.
  
It would have the low driving overhead of a mind mapping tool. As with a mind-mapping tool, you control the logical layout, and the tool does the actual spacial positioning. It would primarily use keypresses, but allow mouse clicks where it makes sense, for example, to specify the destination of a 'cross connection'. The tool would route the cross conenction for you.

A tree topology can be done with simple key presses. The tree would capture the primary relationships between instances, on their main ports.

You can make mutiple trees for different user stories that are disconnected logically, but for the purpose of automatic layout, are connected to the main tree (just an invisible line).

Abstractions are defined in a separate panel as stand-alone boxes with ports. Once a new abstraction is  defined, it can be instantiated in the diagram by its abstraction name with auto completion. Boxes represent these instances of abstractions with the ports still lablled around their boundary.

The abstractions are fully inegrated with the classes in the code. This is in both directions. So for any existing classes, the IDE shows them with their port, and fully supports the entry of constructor arguments and properties.

In the other direction, if you create a new abstraction in the tool. You can specify its ports and their types and names. You can specify the constructor arguments and properties and their default values. It will create/modify a template for that class.cs.

The tool's purpose is to aid creativity in the ALA process of representing a user story, inventing new abstractions as you go. Of course the tool would also automatically generate the wiring code.
....

In my experience, a low overhead drawing tool is essential during the iteration zero design phase and during subsequent maintenance.   


// TBD two sections on decomposition copied in



=== Composition, not decomposition

In this perspective, we look at ALA as the antithesis of the prevalent decomposition methodolgy.

The conventional technique for tackling system complexity is "divide and conquer".

Consider this phrase, which has been used as the definition of software architecture:

[WARNING]
====
"[red]#*decomposition*# of a system into [red]#*elements*# and [red]#*_their_*# [red]#*relations*#".
====

Notice the word 'their', which I have italicised to emphasis that the relations are inferred to be between the decomposed elements. It suggests that the decomposed elements know something about each other, that they collaborate to create the whole.  
In ALA we think about building the system in a completely different way. Here is how to reword the meme for ALA:

[TIP]
====
"[green]#*composition*# of a system using [green]#*instances*# of [green]#*abstractions*#".
====

This seemingly subtle shift in thinking leads to a qualitative difference in the resulting structure. 

First let's understand what we mean by composition through a few examples: 

* When we compose musical notes, we create a tune. The structure is linear. The execution is sequential like activity flow below. 

* When we write code in a general purpose programming language, we are composing  statements. Statements are low level (fine grained) elements and only support a single programming paradigm, which we could describe as 'imperative', but by composing enough instances of them we can create a program. The structure is a linear or a tree.

* In functional programming, we are composing with functions, so the elements are higher level things that you create. But the programming paradigm is still imperative (unless you use monads). The structure is either linear or a tree.

* When programming with monads, we are composing functions. The programming paradigm has changed from imperative to dataflow. The structure is usually linear, but sometimes it is a reverse tree (two dataflows can be combined). (ALA is compared with monads in detail later in this chapter.)

* When programming using the UML class diagram, we are composing with classes directly (not objects). The programming paradigms are associations and inheritance.

* When programming using the UML activity diagram, we are composing activities to be done in a set order. The structure is a graph, because you can branch, recombine and loop back arbitrarily. Activity diagrams are not imperative (like the old style flow diagrams). The CPU is not necessarily dedicated to each activity being done. Activities may take an arbitrarily long time without the system blocking. 

* When programming with XAML, we are composing UI elements. The programming paradigm is UI layout (what goes inside what and in what order). The structure is a tree.



Let's list the different properties present in these types of composition:

* Low-level or high-level - Sometimes we are composing fine-grained general elements and we need a lot of them. Sometimes we are composing 'higher level' more specific elements, and we need relatively few of them.
+
Note that sometimes people think of these higher level elements as more abstract. They are actually less abstract. For example, a class that handles complex numbers is less abstract than the fundamental float type. Complex numbers are a more specific case because its only useful when you need complex numbers in your solution. But when you do need complex numbers, then they are obviously more expressive than using pairs of floats everywhere. This means that you need to compose less abstractions to build your solution.

* There is only one meaning of a composition relationship in each case. It can be one of imperative, dataflow, UI layout etc. 

* Linear/Tree/Network: The structure built by the composition relationships can be linear, a tree structure or a general graph or network. 

* Syntax: The syntax for the composition of two joined elements can be using spaces, dots, or lines on a diagram. We can use various types of bracketing or indenting for the text form of tree structures.

In ALA, we are setting up to use composition to create user stories or features. We want the composition to have the following properties:

* Composing more course grained expressive elements by letting them be specialized to your domain.
* Allow use of many programming paradigms (meaning of composition)
* Allow linear, tree or graph structures.
* Allow the programmer to add new programming paradigms with new meaning if that's the best way to express typical requirements.
* Uses the same syntax for all the different composition relationships.

ALA can therefore be thought of as a 'generalised compose from abstractions' methodology. 



=== No Data coupling

The term _data coupling_ here doesn't mean that one module communicates data with another.  It means that the two modules agree on the meaning of that data.

The actual communication of data at run-time is not a problem. The sharing of knowledge on how to interpret that data is. 

In conventional programming, data coupling is considered unavoidable. There is a misconception meme that two modules have to share the knowledge of the meaning of data if they are to communicate at run-time. Even if you have an understanding of ALA, you will still be trapped by this misconception unless you know about it. This will cause you to write modules in the conventional way and they will have coupling.

The misconception is especially rife if the two modules run in different locations. It seems a self-evident truth that the two modules must share some kind of language if they are to communicate, just as people do. 

Let's use an example. There is a temperature sensor on a Mars rover. The temperature is to be displayed at a ground station on Earth.

In conventional programming, to implement this user story, one module resides in the Mars rover and one module resides in the ground station. These two modules must agree on the meaning of data. For example, it is an integer number of tenths of degrees C (Celsius).

Obviously a lot of other system parts are involved in transporting the data from the sensor module to the display module. These are referred to as middleware. It is common to _containerise_ the data so that none of the middleware needs to know its meaning. But the two end points at least seemingly must have shared knowledge.

In ALA, the _meaning_ of the communication is completely contained inside another abstraction. That abstraction is the only one that knows about the user story, so it's the only one that needs to know the meaning of the data going from Mars to Earth. 

Here is the user story implementation.

[source,C#]
....
class AmbientTempertureUserStory {
    new TemperatureSensor()
        .WireIn(new OffsetAndScale(4.3, 712))
        .WireIn(new Display("#.#"))
}    
....

The meaning of the temperature data does not need to be known outside of this small abstraction. It does not need to be known by the sensor itself, or the display, or anything in-between. The meaning only needs to be known by the engineer who wants the sensor on the rover and wants to see what it says on the display, and so wites the above code.

Now if he were to change the units of temperature were to change, only this user story abstraction would change. Just change the OffsetAndScale configuration, and change the way the display is formatted.

It doesn't even matter if software needs to interpret the data. For example, let's add an alarm that goes off at 50 C: 

[source,C#]
....
    new TempertureSensor()  // unit is celcius
        .WireIn(new OffsetAndScale(4.3, 712))
        .WireTo(new Display("#.#"))
        .WireTo(new Alarm(500));
....

The interpretation of the data is still contained inside the user story abstraction. Everything about that temperature is here as cohesive code. 

==== deployment

The user story code spans physical locations. So how do those instances of abstractions get deployed?

Inside the user story abstraction, we can annotate the three instances with their physical locations. An abstraction that knows about the concept of _physical view_ would already have been configured to know about the three physical locations. The physical view engine takes care of deploying the instances of abstractions for the user story to the correct locations, configuring them, and it takes care of actually connecting both ends through middleware. It also knows how to take care of version compatibility, and updating versions at different times at different locations. 



==== modules written by different parties

What happens if one end of the user story is written by a team that has no communication with the team who does the user story. They just provide an API. In this case the team responsible for the user story itself will write an adapter for the API that also knows about the common programming paradigm abstraction. We can still have a separate abstraction to repesent the whole user story, and keep the data coupling contained in the adapter.

The idea of no data coupling of course relies on the common programming paradigm. It relies on the teams who write the domain abstractions (or the adapters) all using that programming paradigm. And it relies on having a spearate team responsible for the user story, and all teams agreeing to use ALA and the common programming paradigm.  

But there is an organisational problem in the form of Conway's law.

 Conway's law: Any organisation that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organisation's communication structure. 

It is unlikely that there would be a dedicated team in an organisation to write all the code for a specific user story if the user story spans different locations, or code written at different times. These are likely to fall to entirely different departments who both expect the two parts of the system to communicate between an agreed API and contract. In this siutaion there cannot be a separate abstraction for the user story, because there is no department for it. 

So there will be collaboration in the code at each end in the form of data coupling. There will need to be be contracts. The contracts will describe all the implicit coupling. The contract will be a second source of truth, which must be kept updated.

In this situation it is still possible to mitigate the effects of coupling somewhat. Let's say the display end has been written by the 3rd party, but is written in such a way that it accepts _self describing data_ according to a standard. Effectively this is just making it more abstract. Without changing the display end, the user story can be implemented from scratch by sending to the display the self describing data. The display then knows how how to receive the label and display format (which can be sent once) as well as the numeric data. The display knows how to create a space for displaying the data. This is how browsers work. 

It is common, for example, for a 3rd party to provide a sensor and publish the data on an MQTT server as self describing data. Say the other team is writing an application to use this data, not only display it, but interpret the data as well. They will subscribe to the topic. They will write code that is coupled with design knowledge provided by the 3rd party about the MQTT topic.

However, if the 3rd party is selling you abstract sensors that you install yourself and selling you the MQTT communication infrastructure, then you could be provided with a more abstract 'configuration API' from the 3rd party. You would then write a domain abstraction that knows about that configuration API. Whenever you want to do a new user story, you can use an instance of that 'device configuration' abstraction. You can fully configure the MQTT topic, and its data format, then subscribe to it and process it. Everything specific to the user story is now cohesively contained inside a single abstraction once again. 

==== 3rd party library abstractions

All the above applies when teams are supplying peer modules for a system. The modules have a similar level of abstraction. If the 3rd party is providing something more abstract like a library, we can choose to be directly dependent on it, if it is abstract enough to be considered part of the language we want to write user stories in. The canonical example is a relational database with the abstraction being SQL. 

The common problem here is that if the abstraction comes from a 3rd party, we are making ourselves dependent not only on the abstraction, which is ok, but on the provisioning of the implementation. This may be okay when we choose to depend on, for example, the windows or MacOS operating system, but is dubious for a database. (Actually its not ok for Windows either, but being able to swap out windows is considered too hard). So it's become good practice to allow swapping out of the database. And since SQL is not quite as abstract as it should be between vendors, it means we don't want to be dependent on SQL either. 

Clean architecture suggests to do this by using interfaces specific to the user stories, and then writing adapters for every interface to SQL.

In ALA, you probably already have a 'tabular dataflow' type of programming paradigm. All abstractions that deal with tabular data already use ports of that type.

It is a matter of writing one adapter that is configured with the schema. The adapter then generates the appropriate SQL queries.

//TBD provide code example of a lazy dynamic tabular programming paradigm, something like:
////
[source,C#]
....
    interface ITabularDataflow : IQueryable<dynamic>
    {
    }
....
////

We can write a Query domain abstraction that takes a linq query as a parameter. This one abstraction allows us to use LINQ's From, Select, SelectMany, Sort, Where, Join etc. The query abstraction is then has ports to make it wirable into a user story using ALA. Since Linq is already compliant with ALA from the point of view of composing data manipulation abstractions, there is no reason not to use it directly in this way.

TBD Write a query abstraction that takes a LINQ query as a parameter and has ITabularDataflow<T> ports. Shouldn't be too hard so full code can go here.

TBD Write an abstract adapter for SQL Lite database with a special port that is used directly by the Query abstraction. 




=== Composability and Compositionality

We have used the word _compose_ a lot so far in describing ALA. The term _Composability_ means the ability to create an infinite variety of things by composing instances of a finite number of things.

Composability is a very important property for dealing with complexity. The Principle of Compositionality states: In mathematics, semantics, and philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them.

Brian Beckman, who does the best explanation of monads I have found in "Don't fear the monad" says that composability is _the_ way to deal with complexity.

Jules Hedges says of this property "I claim that compositionality is extremely delicate, and that it is so powerful that it is worth going to extreme lengths to achieve it." 

In software engineering, it is described by a pattern called "Abstract Interactions" or "Configurable Modularity" by Raoul de Campo and Nate Edwards - the ability to reuse independent components by changing their interconnections but not their internals. It is said that this characterises all successful reuse systems. 

ALA has these properties by using domain abstractions with ports. The ports are instances of programming paradigms. The domain abstractions are the constituent expressions, and the programming paradigms are the rules used to combine them. 

There are other software systems that have composability, usually using the dataflow programming paradigm, such as RX (Reactive Extensions), or more generally monads. Most composability systems are restricted to a single paradigm. In ALA, to achieve the correct level of expressiveness of requirements, multiple different programming paradigms are needed.





=== ALA compared with Object oriented programming

Let's start with Brian Will's explanation of why object oriented programming is crap from his Youtube channel:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM]

I am in agreement with Brian in that trying to associate _all_ code with data causes inappropriate fragmentation of the code, encourages a model of collaborating agents, and creates a dependency hell. 

The idea of encapsulation is only partially realized because objects effectively know about the existence of another object's state and collaborate with that state. They reach into each other's data indirectly.   

Also the UML class diagram encourages relationships directly between classes, which should be uncoupled abstractions. It encourages mutable data. And it encourages a horrendous model of agents interacting with each others data in a multithreaded environment. To solve this, Brian advocates a return to procedural programming and provides several examples which demonstrate that procedural programming is better.

Although ALA uses objects, it is not object oriented. You don't try to model everything with objects and you can't create associations between classes. It uses objects as a language feature, not a design philosophy. Objects are used in ALA for the following four reasons. 

. Objects store references to other objects to which they are wired. A form of dependency injection is used to receive the references to the other objects. 

. Domain abstractions, being reusable entities, often need configuring. The object stores its own configuration data passed in the constructor or via setters.

. Some abstractions need state to work internally. For example an abstraction that implements a low pass filter for a dataflow needs to keep some kind of historical value or values. It is inherent in the nature of the abstraction that it has state.

. There is usually some state data that doesn't belong with any code. In ALA we will often create a special domain abstraction called 'state' that acts as a source or destination for dataflows.


==== Dependency injection

The dependency injection pattern was introduced as an attempt to clean up the dependency mess created by OOP. It came too late to make the famous GOF patterns book. The authors wish they had included it instead of singleton. But dependency injection alone does not solve OOPs problems.

Previously we mentioned the use of dependency injection in ALA by using the wiring pattern to wire up instances of abstractions by their ports. The way this dependency injection is done is quite different to container based dependency injection. 

Container based dependency injection works by matching interface types. The interfaces are implemented by one class, and required by another. The matching of this interface type is the implicit wiring of the two classes. There is no place where you can see the wiring explicitly. This is really bad. It is very difficult to trace the flow of a user story through the classes.

Now a class may be substitutable with another class that implements or provides the same interfaces. That's why there is a container. You instantiate an object of the class you want to wire in, and put it into the container. But this is a far cry from general composability.

In ALA interfaces do not belong to one or other of the classes being wired. They are more abstract and represent a compositional concept which we call a programming paradigm. When a domain abstraction uses one of these abstract interfaces, either implementing it or using it, we call it a port. The abstraction has no implicit fixed arrangement with other abstractions. A separate abstraction in a higher layer is needed to specify how instances of these abstractions with ports should be composed.

Note that ALA is extremely polymorphic. That's because from the point of view inside an abstraction with ports, you do not know where that port will be wired to. Despite the use of polymorphism for wiring up everything, there is none of the usual disadvantage of indirection. In fact it is way easier to trace through a proram or system. From inside an abstraction, the abstraction doesn't need or want to know where it is wired. It's completely self-readable up to the port. And if you are trying to trace a dataflow through the program or system, well that's explicit and all in one place for any given user story.


=== From procedural programming to ALA

Let's get back to procedural programming that Brain Will advocates instead of object oriented programming. How does ALA relate to procedural programming?

Starting from pure procedural programming, we will make five step changes to get to ALA. In this progression, you will see that we introduce objects but not object oriented programming per se.

. To begin with, you can apply ALA directly to procedural programming style. Abstractions are implemented as groups of procedures. You must structure the code so that you only call procedures in an abstraction that is significantly more abstract. You will have user story abstractions in the top layer, and domain abstractions in a second layer. Procedures that directly code a given user story are put together to form a user story abstraction. Procedures that are cohesive in the domain layer, such as configure/read/write sets, are grouped together as abstractions. Such abstractions could be implemented as a code source file or a static class.

. Once you have abstractions, you can of course reuse them. Abstractions often need configuring. Configuring requires storing some data. We can put the configuration data inside the abstraction, and provide constructor parameters or setters. Since the abstraction now contains some data, the abstraction needs to be implemented as a class so that it can be instantiated with each instance having it own configuration. So already we have objects.
+
For example, a filter abstraction needs configuring with a cutoff frequency and a stop band rejection. If the abstraction consisted only of a function, then that configuration data would need to be passed in every time the function is used. That would be awkward. It would also mix the dataflow parameters of the function with the configuration parameters, breaking the Interface Segregation Principle. By using objects, ALA can configure an abstraction once, and then the contained function can be used may times. This separation of configuration and function use is important for abstractions - the configuration is done at instantiation time of the abstraction, whereas the function can be used many times once it is running.

. In procedural programming, the user story will frequently call one procedure, get some data returned by that procedure and then pass it straight to another. This handling of data is not really something the abstraction should need to do. It should just compose procedures. But if we make the abstractions classes, then we can wire the instances so that at run-time data flows directly from one instance to another. Control of execution becomes the responsibility of dataflow programming paradigms. Now we have two reasons to use objects.




. In procedural programming, you will tend to have some state variables, which are practically globals. We won't call them globals because we wouldn't access them directly from any procedures. We would instead always pass them into the procedures as required. This would create extra parameters for our procedures. Some procedures will need extra parameters even though they don't know what the data is. They are just passing it through to other procedures they call. All this extra passing around is a real pain. 
+
Sometimes an abstraction is by its very nature stateful. Some of the data may really belong with a given procedure internally, so the pain seems to make no sense.
+
For example, a running average abstraction needs to hold past values. In procedural programming, the array of past values is kept in the top layer and is passed into the function every time. This completely breaks the abstraction. In ALA, we keep the state and code together to preserve the abstraction. This is what objects were meant for.
+
In a multithreaded environments, it would be prudent for only one thread to be using each instance of such objects. 
+
For user story abstractions, there is probably one instance per application, so the class could be static. But once again we need objects.

. Lastly, there may still be state data that does not belong to a specific abstraction. This will be sitting around in a top layer looking like a global. In object oriented programming, this is the type of data we would stuff into a class anyway, and then have almost pointless accessor methods. The other classes then have harmful dependencies on these data classes. Furthermore, the dataflows through such a network of objects is completely obfuscated. 
+
In ALA, what we do is create a domain abstraction for such state. This abstraction has dataflow input/output ports. Instances of the abstraction can then be a source/destination of data. These are wired into data flows in the same way as any other dataflow domain abstraction. We can create instances of it for each item of state data needed by the application. Such state objects are not globals, nor do they need to be passed around. Other domain abstractions do not even know about them. Instead they are wired to them by the user story abstractions using dataflow ports. This is another legitimate reason for using objects. 
+
If the type system is dynamic, a state abstraction could hold any complex data structure, and the user stories it is wired to can use the data in a dynamic way.
Only the application layer would know the actual structure of the data at design-time. Or it may be completely dynamic until run-time.
+
If the type system is static, and we want to group data together in a single instance of a state abstraction, The application layer can use an explicit or implicit struct type. If explicit, the state abstraction will be a generic, and the struct type is passed to it at compile-time. User stories that are wired to the state instance will also have the struct type passed to them. The other way to do it is type inferencing if your language supports this. The source of the dataflow is given a type at compile-time, and the rest of the dataflow gets their types from type inference.
// TBD example of type inference between two domain abstractions.


Through the five steps above, we have transformed procedural code into ALA code. We have used objects, but we did not use object oriented design. The resulting ALA version has these properties:

* No class knows of the existence of state in any other class. If a UML diagram was drawn, it have no association relationships between peer domain abstration classes.

* Despite the fact that we use objects, the ALA constraints avoid most of the problems of conventional object oriented programming. For example, both the configuration data, and the wiring data stored in an instance can be immutable. Only instances of abstractions that contain state data are mutable, and this is clear from very nature of the abstraction. 


////
==== Immutable state

In the previous section in point 5, we talked about a state abstraction.

The state abstraction should be immutable. At first this does not seem to make sense. What use is state that is immutable? This is the big idea behind the proramming language Clojure. Think of the state domain abstraction as being a time series of all its previous states. When the output dataflow port is used to get the state, it returns a reference to the data (or boxed data if it's a simple type). The data at that reference will now never change. It is a snapshot in time, and all subsequent processing of that state data by the user story can be done taking its time. User stories can take time, for example when waiting for external inputs. Other user stories can run at the same time. So we can have concurrency even in a singe threaded application. These other user stories can change the state in the same instance of the state abstraction, without affecting the first user story that has not completed yet.

When the input port of the state abstraction is used to change the state, it, in effect, copies the state and then stores the reference as the new latest state. For performance reasons, the implementation should not actually copy large amounts of data - it should use the same idea of optimized immutable data containers that clojure uses. The parts of a data container that are changed are copied, and the new container refers to the older containers for the rest of the data.    
+
It is an advantage of having a state abstraction that you can implement immutability once and then reuse it for all wired state that your application needs.
////


=== How ALA fixes object oriented programming

Unconstrained or overdone object oriented programming causes serious issues:

. Data gets associated with code, whether it makes a good abstraction or not. 

. Code ends up 'reaching in' via class associations to get or manipulate data in other classes, creating coupling.

. Multithreading issues like race conditions and deadlocks. 

ALA solves these issues by

. Only putting data with code when it makes a good abstraction. Other data goes into 'data' abstractions.

. Associations between abstractions are illegal.

. Asynchronous dataflow programming paradigms ensure that any given instance of an abstraction only executes on one thread. Where local synchronous communication is used, groups of instances always run on the same thread.



=== ALA Compared with functional programming


==== ALA can be applied to pure functional programming

The fundamental ALA constraints could be applied directly to pure functional programming (not using monads). This would require that the functions be abstractions, and that functions would only call or use functions that are significantly more abstract than themselves.

But the functions would not be great abstractions for two reasons.

1) Functions expose their inputs and outputs to the layer above, but the layer above is not interested in the data itself, only in the abstract concept of what the function does. It just wants to compose the functions with other functions, not deal with the run-time data.

2) Functions, or sets of functions, that naturally associate strongly with some state must have their state passed into and back out of them every time they are used. The layer above needs to handle this state data for the function. If the composing functions are intermediate level, they themselves will need to receive and return the state from high functions.
+
Functional programming in one way encourages abstractions by not allowing side effects. However, this also destroys any abstractions that would otherwise be highly coherent with their own state. 
+
This problem gets even worse when there are several layers of functions. The middle layer functions end up with extra parameters that don't have anything to do with them, just so they can pass state data through to even lower functions. This makes these intermediate functions not great abstractions in themselves.

Both ALA and monads solve these problems.



==== ALA uses state

The ALA constraints can be used for either object oriented or purely functional programming. Either way, using abstractions that have zero coupling with one another changes how the code is organised for the better.

In pure functional programming, if the data and the functions are good abstractions, then the structure is already ALA compliant. Both the data and the functions are in the domain abstractions layer. Then user story functions in a higher layer passes the data to the functions. 

However, it is unlikely that pure functions that require state to be passed into them are also good abstractions. An example would be an averaging filter for a stream of data. Passing the running average to the function every timer there is new input data breaks an otherwise good abstraction. There are many situations when insistence on referential transparency makes a computation more awkward and less precise, and it is this loss of abstraction that causes this.

 In fairness pure functional prgramming uses monads to partially solve this problem. ALA is actually somewhat analogous to monads. Monads are a mechanism that allow the creation of abstractions that can be wired together, similar to domain abstractions. Indeed ALA user stories that wire instances of domain abstractions use pure functional code. A full explanation of monads for programmers who know nothing about them, but are familiar with imperative programming in C# is in chapter six. They are compared in detail with ALA. Essentially domain abstractions together with programming paradigms are a more versatile, powerful but conceptually simpler analog of monads.  

ALA prioritizes abstraction over referential transparency as its method to achieve analysability. This sometimes results in pure functions and more often results in objects with mutable state. When using objects though, ALA's big difference from conventional object oriented programming is that the classes must be much better abstractions (because they can have no associations with one another).

The use of state in conventional object oriented programming is considered a problem for two reasons. 

. Class methods lack the advantages of referential transparency. Referential transparency essentially works by removing time as factor when analysing or understanding a section of code.

. At runtime, methods called on different threads can cause issues such as race conditions, deadlocks, and priority inversions.

For the first problem, instead of removing time as an internal mechanic of the way classes work, ALA removes all coupling with other classes. So the class is locally analysable even if it contains state. This allows many computational problems that naturally involve time or ordered operations to be expressed in a straightforward way, without descending into the quagmire conventional unrestrained imperative programming.   

Many systems or subsystems are inherently state machines anyway - they are driven by events and need to change their behaviour according to their history. Programs for such systems ultimately have mutable state. Functional programming tends to separate that state out causing a lot of design-time coupling between functons and their data. Object oriented programming on the other hand tends to encapsulate it with methods too much, causing a lot of coupling with other classes that indirectly use the data. ALA solves both these problems. 

State is a fundamental aspect of _computation_. I define a 'computation' as some state and a function:

 input + state --> state + output. 

We can associate the state in two ways:

 (input + state) --> (state + output)

 input ( + state --> state +) output

The first form is the pure functional form. The second form is the object oriented form.

In ALA we can use either form depending on where the abstractions are. When there is some state that is used by multiple user stories, then it would be put in its own abstraction. For example, a blackboard pattern or a game score could be an abstraction itself. This abstraction could then be wired by user story abstractions in a higher layer to various abstractions implemented as pure functions.

In ALA we choose between these two philosophies on a case by case basis. When it makes sense to put state with methods as a class, and that makes a good abstraction, then there is no resulting coupling of that state with other classes. On the other hand, when it makes sense to keep state separate, we can put it in its own separate abstraction (usually as a class with simple accessor methods). Either way, what you then must not do is create direct associations between these classes. That will break them as abstractions. Instead, top layer user stories wire up insteances of those classes using ports.

In other words, the problem with object oriented programming is not that objects contain state per-se. It is that most classes are not good abstractions of a computation. We allow other objects to 'reach' into them or couple with them at design-time. They know there is state there, even if that 'reaching in' is via methods. This coupling is what makes conventional programs with state so hard to reason about.  

In summary, ALA enforces abstraction instead of referential transparency.

===== Multithreaded programming with state

The second problem with object oriented programming is multi-threaded environments. 
This is true even if we are using abstractions. That's because multi-threaded issues happen at run-time and abstractions only deal with design-time coupling. At rn-time, instances of abstractions communicate in ALA just as much as they do in conventional object oriented programs. The abstractions themselves may not know anything about each other, but their instances are wired to communicate.

If the programming paradigms used for the wiring use asynchronous method calls, there is not problem with multi-threading. But if the programming paradigms used for the wiring use synchronous method calls, there will be issues such as race conditions, deadlocks or priority inversions.

Effectively this is a dependency of all domain abstractions on an understanding that if synchronous method calling is used in the programming paradigm, two instances should not be wired if they run on different threads. 

This is fine under the ALA constraints. Domain abstractions that contain state have a knowledge dependency that programming paradigms that use synchronous must be used only for instances that run on one thread. The user stories in the layer above similarly have this knowledge dependency. With this knowledge dependency, domain abstractions can be written without regard to thread safety, and user stories must be written only use synchronous programming paradigms for wiring instances of domain abstractions that run on the same thread. 

You could argue that this knowledge used in the user stories is a violation of ALA in that the user story, as an abstraction expressing a requirement, should not also have to be concerned with this knowledge. This is a valid criticism.  

From the point of view of the domain abstractions, you can write them so that they can be used for either asynchronous or synchronous. A port that uses a programming paradigm that is asynchronous can be used either asynchronously or synchronously. The user story can configure whether the programming paradigm instance uses synchronous or asynchronous at design time. User stories can then follow the GALS principle (Globally Asynchronous, locally synchronous) applied to threads.  

Writing domain abstractions to use asynchronous programming paradigms is more difficult than ones that use synchronous programming paradigms. The difficulty comes when the port is used with an outgoing method call that returns a value. Such programming paradigms might be simple pull style data transfers, request/response type, or perhaps programming paradigms that return an error. 

Using push style programming paradigms by default for data transfers mitigates this problem in most cases. That's why in ALA I recommend push style or reactive programming by default.

But when something must be returned, and we want to use an asynchronous port, this forces the domain abstraction to be a state machine. By far the easiest way to do this is to use async/await. This allows the domain abstraction to be written in the synchronous style, save for the addition of *async* and *await* keywords everywhere in the code. The compiler turns the code into the required state machine. 

If async/await is not available, but tasks or future objects are available, then you can use a bind function to chain the task objects. This will allow you to chain operations using dot syntax, which is just as elegant as a chain of synchronous calls. This is effectivly a monad. Monads are fully explained in chapter six. 

If you can't even use the task monad, then the domain abstractions must be written in the style of a state machine. 

Turning an outgoing port method call into a state machine means moving all the code that is after the method call into a separate call back function. Any local variables in the containing method become state that persists until the callback function is called. Writing code in this way can be straight-forward or awkward. If it's awkward, at least it is confined to the internals of an abstraction. 

Remember all this is only necessary when you want to write domain abstractions whose instances can be wired to run on different threads (or over a network). 



==== ALA compared with monads

In chapter six the first section explains monads for people familar with imperative programming. Here we just give a comparison of ALA and monads, assuming prior familiarity with monads. We will show how ALA does a similar job to monads, but in a more powerful, more versatile and more straight-forward way. 

When we use the term _monad library_ in this section, we are referring to a whole library based on monads. For the most common monad, the monad based on IEnumerable, this library consists of the familiar functions such as Select, Where and Order found in LINQ.  

Strictly speaking the monad itself only has the Bind function (which is *SelectMany* in the case of the IEnumerable monad), not all the other map and reduce functions you find in the library as well. 


===== Monads compose functions, ALA composes objects

The fundamental difference between ALA and monads is that ALA composes objects whereas monads compose functions. Monads often use objects under the covers, but in the application code you are composing functions.

With a monad library, your application code can combine functions in two different ways.

. Compose more generic functions that essentially compose lambda functions. These more generic functions include Bind (SelectMany), Map (Select), Reduce (Aggregate), Filter (Where), Join, and GroupBy. Each takes a lambda function. The application code is composing both the generic functions and the specific lambda functions that are passed to them.

. Compose more specific functions such as Repeat, Cast, Sum, First, Concat, Order. These functions generally work by themselves without also composing other functions passed to them. 

Whether we consider the more generic functions, the specific functions, or the lambda functions, most all the functions just have two 'ports', an input and an output. The input is the first parameter and the output is the return value. (Some functions such as Join, Zip, Concat, take two inputs.) ALA's domain abstractions, on the other hand, can have many ports for their inputs and outputs. These ports can use different programming paradigms, not just a specific data flow such as IEnumerable. This makes ALA abstractions more general. 

Furthermore, most of the monad library functions are designed to work with finite sequences. Sum, for example, requires the input sequence to complete. ALA ports can, and often are just a stream of data for the lifetime of the application. When data is in batches, such as from a file or database query, the ports use programming paradigms that handle batches of data. Such a programming paradigm is a stream of sequences (see IObserverPush in chapter six for an example). The ports remain wired for the lifetime of the application. For monad libraries, the composed expression is usually rewired for each use (although an IEnumerable can be saved in a variable and then reused). This is especially true for the reactive extensions, in which most functions stop working once OnCompleted or OnError occurs.

So the mental model of how monad libraries and ALA domain abstractions are composed is different. Monad library expressions are a declarative version of a finite loop such as a forloop. It builds an object structure for lazy execution. But these expressions are wired in isolation and then executed within the context of conventional imperative code.

In ALA, on the other hand, the entire user story is built declaratively because the ports use programming paradigms that declaratively support everything needed to express a user story. The entire object structure representing the user story, indeed the entire application, is wired once, and then set running for the lifetime of the application.

Having said that, WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) provides a declarative way to build the UI. So when WPF is used with bindings to LINQ expressions, more of the user story can be expressed declaratively. ALA just makes the idea of declarative programming generalized to the point where you always build the entire application declaratively.

To use an analogy, ALA's domain abstractions are somewhat analogous to wiring integrated circuits in electronics. Like domain abstractions, integrated circuits can have multiple ports (pins) of different types to suit what the overall abstraction of the part. Monad libraries are more like discrete electronic components such as resistors and capacitors, components that just support analog data with a single input and output.   


===== Monad versus ALA syntax

In ALA application layer code, you are wiring up instances of abstractions that have multiple ports in an arbitrary network (that expresses a whole cohesive user story).

In monad library application layer code, you are generally chaining functions, and only wiring up a dataflow. So the monad library code can look more succinct for the specific part that involves the chain of functions:

monad version
[source,C#]
....
source.Filter(x => x>0).Select(x => x+1)
....


ALA version
[source,C#]
....
source.WireIn(new Filter(x => x>=0)).WireIn(new Select(x => x+1)
....

However, we wouldn't normally create ALA domain abstractions to do the same job as monads if we already have a monad library. Instead, we would use the monads, and their more direct syntax to configure an ALA domain abstraction. Chapter six has full details of how to this.

More generally, in ALA the usual pattern is to explicitly instantiate the domain abstractions using _new_ and then explicitly wire their ports using _WireTo_ or _WireIn_. We could create extension methods to combine these two operations, but we prefer to keep it explicit because conceptually we are wiring up a network like wiring up components of a schematic diagram. Extension methods that wire abstraction directly using dot syntax are only elegant for building linear chains.

If the application code is generated from a diagram, it doesn't make any difference, but if you are hand writing the wiring code, the ALA syntax is longer. But it's more obvious what is happening.

Monad library code usually builds large object structures full of delegate objects, closure objects and other 'under the covers' objects. This 'under the covers' structure makes monads difficult to understand, trace and debug, compared to ALA object structures. 


===== Deferred Monads vs wiring classes with ports

Monad Bind functions can call the composed function immediately to return an actual value, or they can return an object that can be used later to get the value. For example, monad library functions that return an IEnumerable or IObservable are the deferred form. They can also work using either pull or push. It is the deferred/push form of monads that most closely compares with ALA, so that's the type of monad we will concentrate on in this section. 

The deferred versions of monads are more difficult to understand in terms of equivalent imperative code because relatively simple expressions create large object structures containing delegates, closure, or other objects under the covers. You can't really see any of them.  This also makes them difficult to debug. Example diagrams of these structures are shown in Chapter six.

ALA is easier to understand because it uses plain objects. You instantiate and wire up these objects yourself. 

The only thing that is peculiar to ALA over conventional objected oriented programming is that the ALA objects must use _ports_. You are not allowed to make a class have an association with another peer class. You are not even allowed to make an association with a same layer interface.  

Ports can be thought of as dependency injection with two constraints.

. The interfaces must be significantly more abstract. These interfaces are called programming paradigms because they give meaning to the wiring.  

. The dependency injection wiring must be explicit. It must be specified in code in a cohesive user story abstraction in a higher layer. The wiring cannot be done by using a dependency injection container or relying on matching interfaces. Because port interfaces are more abstract and can be used by many disparate classes, there is an infinite number of ways that objects could be wired together.

Another difference about ALA dependency injection is that I like to use reflection and implement a single WireTo extension method for wiring every type of port. That way I don't need constructor injection or setter injection methods for every port of every domain abstraction class. 

That's pretty much all there is to understanding the wiring of ALA classes.




==== Why prefer deferred/push monads?

We mentioned that deferred/push monads are closest to ALA. For the case of IObservable, these are the reactive extensions library. Deferred/push monads have two useful properties.

. The first property comes from being deferred. Often people write a deferred query using monads, and then immediately run the query. The deferred nature of the monads is not really utilized because the query is used immediately. Usually it needs to be run immediately because even though the query itself is a declarative description of a dataflow, it is used in an imperative context.
+
Now imagine constructing a deferred query, and then wiring it into still more declarative code that describes the entire user story. It is the deferred property of the query code that allows us to build the query along with the UI, the schema, the business logic, etc, all declaratively. Once the whole program is built, it can be set running. 
+
Building a query from deferred monads once with SelectMany, Select etc, and then reusing it many times as the program runs means that the monads must be designed to be used more than once. The monads based on IEnumerable are fine in this respect because it has a Reset method that can be used to re-run the IEnumerable. However monads based on the IObservable interface are not designed to be able to run more than once. Once that OnCompleted or OnError method is called, the object structure wont run ever again. It has to be reconstructed by re-running the SelectMany and Selects, which will re-run the Subscribe method calls. I think this design in reactive extension is rather limiting. You can have so called 'hot' observables, but that just means they never call OnCompleted or OnError.
+
So when I use IObservable monads as part of a user story, I need rebuild the query in imperative code each time it is used. With ALA domain abstractons, I can build the query once and wire it into the rest of the user story that also uses declarative code.

. The other advantage of deferred/push monads is the fact that they use push. In ALA we design dataflow or event programming paradigms to use push by default, and only use pull if there is some good reason to use pull.
+
The difference is that push can be either synchronous or asynchronous, whereas pull can only be synchronous (unless you use future objects.)


////
This method I make a push method, so it initiates from the source. I will often add an additional method that runs at the start of a data transfer as well. This method is to carry information such as header information. To accommodate this additional function, I don't use IObserver as the interface for the port. IObserver becomes something within the interface for the port. 

Sometimes I will add an additional method going in the opposite direction to the dataflow which is used by the destination to request that the data transfer starts. In an IObservable interface, the Subscribe method has two functions. Firstly it is used to wire up the IObserver interface in the opposite direction. Well in ALA, that is done by WireIn which wires IObserver interfaces, so we don't need the IObservable interface. However the other function of Subscribe is to request a data transfer. Sometimes we do want the destination end to request the data, even when the source is going to push it through. So in this case I will add a method to the interface to request a data transfer. 

You may think it would be better to use IEnumerable instead, but there is an advantage to using IObservable even when the destination needs to request the data. And that is that the IObserver interface can execute asynchronously. Since the domain abstractions themselves do not always know when they will be used in situations that need asynchronous communications, it is a great advantage to use push style programming paradigms which can do either synchronous or asynchronous, especially when there may be a lot of data to be transferred. It allows the data to be sent in batches. (IEnumerable can be made to work asynchronously as well, but it a lot more complicated as it involves futures.) 

The method used by the destination to request a data transfer goes in the opposite direction from the interface that actually carries the data. We could implement it as a C# event in that interface. This would mean that we have one interface, and it is wired in the direction of the dataflow. When using this 'request' programming paradigm, it seems more natural to wire in the direction of the request rather than in the direction of the dataflow. Therefore, I use a second interface, which is analogous to the IObservable interface. This new interface has the request method, and is the one we use for wiring. The first time a request is made, the method send the requesting object, which allows the source object to wire the interface that goes in teh opposite direction. 

In ALA, because we can create programming paradigms and design the interface for them, it is easy to implement all the aforementioned extra methods and the interface.

=== Dependency graphs for ALA vs conventional code

Our example for this chapter compares dependency graphs for a legacy application and one with the same functionality written in ALA.

The legacy application had been maintained for approximately 20 years, so as might be expected, maintenance had become difficult. In fact there were certain new requirements we could not do because of the prohibitive effort. Normally I wouldn't ever re-write an application. But I wanted to run a research experiment to see how ALA would work on it. I had intern students available, and it would give us an opportunity to compare metrics of the two code bases.

The original application has around 70 KLOC. Rather than look at any of the details of the application itself, we present here dependency graphs generated by Ndepend for the legacy application and the new ALA application.

==== Legacy application dependency graphs

One of the core tenets of ALA (as discussed in an earlier section) is "Composition using layers" instead of "Hierarchical decomposition using encapsulation". Unfortunately Ndepend is designed with the assumption that the application should be built using the latter approach. It likes to present a decomposition structure, starting with assemblies (packages) at the outermost level, then namespaces, and then classes. I'm not sure why it considers namespaces a viable encapsulation mechanism because they don't provide encapsulation. 


////
Anyway, here is the namespace dependency graph for the main assembly of the legacy version of the application, as it comes out of Ndepend.

image::old-datalink/namespaces.png[namespaces.png, title="Legacy application - namespaces", link=images/old-datalink/namespaces.png]

This graph is quite large, so if you like you can right click on it, and open it in a new tab in your browser. The red arrows are dependencies in both directions.

Each box represents a namespace. The thickness of the arrows is proportional to the number fo dependencies between pairs of namespaces. The size of the boxes is proportional to the number of lines of code in the namespace.

If we drill down into the largest namespace, UIForms, we see the class relationships between classes inside that namespace:


image::old-datalink/classes-in-uiforms-namespace.png[classes-in-uiforms-namespace.png, title="Legacy application - classes in uiforms namespace", link=images/old-datalink/classes-in-uiforms-namespace.png]

Here you can see that Ndepend is trying to make out the layers. The layers are vertical columns, going from left to right. I have left them vertical even through ALA abstraction layers are usually drawn horizontal because they come out more readable on the page. Again there are many dependencies in both directions drawn in red.

Here are the classes inside the DataStructure namespace:

image::old-datalink/classes-in-datastructure-namespace.png[classes-in-datastructure-namespace.png, title="Legacy application - classes in datastructure namespace", link=images/old-datalink/classes-in-datastructure-namespace.png]

There is one class called Device which actually looks like it might be a good abstraction.
////

Namespaces provide no useful decomposition structure. They do not make abstractions in themselves, nor do they implement a facade pattern or an aggregate root type of pattern with even logical encapsulation. Any classes inside each namespace can have unconstrained direct relationships with any classes in any other namespace.

So Ndepend out of the box gives us a false picture, because it omits all dependencies that go in or out of namespaces. To really get an idea of what the class dependency graph looks like, I configured Ndepend to use a query that gives me all the classes in all the namespaces. Here is what the legacy application truly looks like: 

image::old-datalink/classes-in-all-namespaces.png[classes-in-all-namespaces.png, title="Legacy application - all classes in all namespaces",link=images/old-datalink/classes-in-all-namespaces.png]

This graph is very large. Right click on it, and open it in a new tab in your browser, so you can zoom in to see the dependencies in the background. It is truly frightening. Ndepend had no chance to find the dependency layers. There may be vague onion type layers going outwards from the middle. It makes readily visible why continued maintenance on this application is so difficult. You have to read a lot of code to find even a tiny part of this hidden structure.

The developer who maintains the application tells me this is a fair reflection of the complexity that he has to deal with.

To be fair, some of the dependencies in this diagram are 'good' dependencies (as described in an earlier section on good and bad dependencies). For example, the box near south-east called ScpProtocolManager has a lot of dependencies coming into it, which means it is possibly used a lot and therefore is potentially good abstraction. Ndepend does not know about the concept of good and bad dependencies, but if it did I would have it just display the bad ones.   


==== New ALA application dependency graphs

Here is the equivalent Ndepend generated class dependency graph for the new ALA version of the application. This graph has the classes from all namespaces.


image::new-datalink/classes-in-all-namespaces.png[classes-in-all-namespaces.png, title="New ALA application - classes in all namespaces", link=images/new-datalink/classes-in-all-namespaces.png]

You can see the three ALA layers which are vertical and go from left to right. Only the Application sits in the top layer. The DomainAbstractions layer contains the next two columns of classes and a few from the next column. And the ProgrammingParadigms layer contains the rest on the right. Actually there were a couple of bad dependencies present when this graph was generated which have since been fixed. (There should be no dependency between Panel and OptionBox, nor between Wizard and WizardItem.) With these removed, the graph would form into the three abstraction layers. 

The newly rewritten application is a work in progress at this point. However, as features are added, this is all the dependencies you will ever see. The Application already uses most of the domain abstractions we will ever need, and the domain abstractions already use the programming paradigm interfaces they need. There are a few DomainAbstractions to be added, but this is essentially what the class dependency graph will stay looking like.  

////
But just for interest, here is Ndepend's namespace dependency graph.


image::new-datalink/namespaces.png[namespaces.png, title="New ALA application - namespaces", link=images/new-datalink/namespaces.png]

Remember in ALA namespaces are layers. The dependencies are correct for the layers. 

Let's drill inside the domain abstraction namespace to see the interdependencies within that layer. We expect to see no dependencies:


image::new-datalink/classes-in-domainabstractions-namespace.png[classes-in-domainabstractions-namespace.png, title="New ALA application - classes in DomainAbstractions namespace", link=images/new-datalink/classes-in-domainabstractions-namespace.png]


Ok here we see the two previously mentioned bad dependencies, and two other dependencies. They are on delegates or enums in the same source file, and so don't count as bad dependencies.

And finally, let's drill into the ProgrammingParadigms namespace

image::new-datalink/classes-in-programmingparadigms-namespace.png[classes-in-programmingparadigms-namespace.png, title="New ALA application - Classes in Programming Paradigms namespace", link=images/new-datalink/classes-in-programmingparadigms-namespace.png]

Again we see a few dependencies on delegates in the same source file which are ok. There is a couple of connector classes that depend on interfaces in this same layer. I consider them part of the interface from the programming paradigm point of view. They are in the same source file as a cohesive unit.

////

As of this writing, the new ALA version of the application is still a research project, but so far everything has gone smoothly with two weeks spent doing the description of the requirements as a diagram, and 18 months so far spent writing the domain abstractions. So far there are no issues getting it to actually execute. It is expected that we will actually commercialize the project soon and replace the old application.


==== The application's diagram

As we said in this chapter, diagrams can be an important aspect of ALA when the user story naturally contains a network of relationships among its instances of abstractions. In this application this is the case. There are UI relationships between elements of the UI. There are dataflow relationships between UI elements, data processing elements, and data sources. There are event-flows from UI to wizards and between wizards and the SaveFileBrowser. and there are minor dataflows such as a the filepath from the file browser to the csvFileReaderWriter.

Here is a sample section from the application diagram that shows all the relationships that implement the user story:

image::DatalinkApplication.xmind.png[DatalinkApplication.xmind.png, title="Xmind being used to design an application", align="center", link=images/DatalinkApplication.xmind.png]

This diagram was drawn using Xmind. It shows a single user story.  There is a UI with a menu item or a tool bar to start the user story. It then displays a browse dialogue to specify the location of the file. When the filepath has been selected, it gets data off a device on a COM port, using a protocol, and writes it to a CSV file. The data is also routed to be shown on a grid on the UI.

The user story diagram makes use of four different programming paradigms (which become four different interface types). Firstly there is the UI structure consisting of the window with its menubar, grid etc arranged inside it. Secondly, there is an event connection for when the menu is clicked which opens the browse dialog. Thirdly a dataflow connection carries the output of the browse dialog, a string containing the selected filepath, to the CSVFileReaderWriter. Another dataflow connection carries characters between the COM port and the SCPProtocol and another carries SCPcommands from the SessionDataSCP. The forth programming paradigm is a table dataflow that carries dynamic columns and rows of data from the SessionDataSCP object to the grid object in the UI and to the CSVFileReaderWriter. 

Having drawn the diagram to represent the user story, we need to make the diagram execute. When we started this particular project we had no tool for automatically generating the code from the diagram, but during the project, one of the interns wrote a tool to do this. It parsed the Json output from Xmind and generated C# wiring code equivalent to what we will show below.

However, at first we were hand generating code, and it is instructive to know what this hand generated code looks like, just so we know how the diagram actually executes. 

When we were hand generating the code, it was important that the code was readable from the point of view of seeing how it corresponds exactly with the diagram. (It wasn't important that the code was readable from the point of view of seeing how the user story works - that was the job of the diagram.)  We had various conventions to support the one to one matching of diagram and code. One of these conventions was to indent the code to exactly mirror the tree structures in the diagram. Another was that whenever a new instance of an abstraction instantiated, all its ports would be wired immediately, and they would be wired in the order they were declared in the abstraction. This implies a depth first wiring strategy, analogous to walking the diagram tree depth first. Any ports with cross connections (the red lines in the diagram) would also be wired to their destinations at the time the abstraction were instantiated. If the destination instance did not already exist it would be pre-instantiated. 

Using these conventions, it is a simple matter to hand generate the code below from the diagram.

We used a 'diagram first' rule to keep the diagram and code in sync. Change the diagram first, then change the wiring code.

As of this writing, a graphical IDE is being developed for these types of ALA applications.
