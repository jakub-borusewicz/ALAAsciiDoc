<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a quick summary of ALA read section 3.1 and then 2.1, then perhaps one of the example projects at the end of each chapter.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Organisation of this site:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter One, "What problem does ALA solve" explains the current major crisis in software engineering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter Two, "What does the structure look like?" without explaining how or why, decribes the structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter Three, "Why the structure works" explains why this structure solves the problems outlined in chapter one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter Four, "Execution models", explains the different ways to make the CPU execute the right code at the right time when the organisation of the code that emerges from ALA is completely independent of the execution flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter Five, "Methodology", describes ALA in terms of where it fits into Agile software development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter Six, "The philosophy behind ALA", gives the theory of why ALA works from the perspective of complex systems and how our brains work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter Seven, "ALA compared with&#8230;&#8203;", compares ALA with existing architectural styles and patterns, both similarities and differences. Choose the one you are most familiar with to see how ALA uses it, builds on it, or contrast with it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each chapter ends with an example project or two. These projects ground the architecture in real code. Unlike most pedagogical sized examples, these examples are progressively non-trivial. Yet because of ALA&#8217;s power, they remain small and easily readable.</p>

<h3 id="truethe-big-ball-of-mud"><a class="anchor" href="#truethe-big-ball-of-mud"></a>1.1. The Big Ball of Mud</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA is an in-the-large strategy to organise code. It provides the constraints needed for the code structure to never degenerate into sphagetti code, or what Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder describe as a "big ball of mud". As the software  life cycle continues, retaining the organisation becomes easier rather than harder. This is because of increasing reuse of software artefacts within the organisation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="trueexisting-architectural-patterns"><a class="anchor" href="#trueexisting-architectural-patterns"></a>1.2. Existing architectural patterns</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many existing architectural styles, patterns, or principles: loose coupling and high cohesion, information hiding, layers, decomposition, DSLs, components, aspects, models, event-driven, MVC, composite, inversion of control, functional programming, object oriented design, UML Class diagrams are all examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This set is sufficient, but there is no overarching strategy that tells you how to combine tham all in a coherent way. in most cases they are used in an ad-hoc manner that doesn&#8217;t work. In some cases their use is actually harmful. ALA provides a large scale organisational framework into which all of these fit.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="truean-optimal-reference-architecture"><a class="anchor" href="#truean-optimal-reference-architecture"></a>1.3. An optimal reference architecture</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA is a reference architecture. It is independent of any specific domain, so it is a general reference architecture. The reference architecture is 'optimal' for certain non-functional requirements. By optimal, I mean that it makes these qualities as good as they can be.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Readability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complexity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintainability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testability</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If other non-functional requirements are also important, ALA provides a good starting point. Even if the ALA structure must be compromised for other qualities, it is still better to start with these quality attributes optimised and deviate from them as necessary. As it happens, the maintainability resulting from ALA frequently makes other quality attributes easy to achieve as well. For example, in an ALA application it is often easy to make performance optimizations in the execution model that don&#8217;t affect the application code. Or, you can port an application without changing the application code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a meme in the software industry that says that the complexity of software must be some function of its size. This need not be so. With proper use of abstraction it is possible to have complexity that is constant regardless of program size. ALA makes use of this.</p>

<h4 id="truemaintainability"><a class="anchor" href="#truemaintainability"></a>1.3.3. Maintainability</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The maintainability effort over time should qualitatively follow the green curve in the graph below because as software artefacts are written, their reuse should reduce the effort required for other user stories. Product owners seem to have an innate sense that we manage to organise our code such that this happens. That is why they get so frustrated when things seem to take longer and longer over time, and they often ask us "haven&#8217;t we done this before". In practice, too often we follow the red curve. Maintenance eventually gets so difficult that we want to throw it away and start again. We reason we can do better. My experience is that we don&#8217;t do better when we rewrite. We just create another mess. It is just a psychological bias on the part of the developer caused by a combination of a) the Dunning Kruger effect and b) the fact that it is easier to read our own recently written code than someone else&#8217;s.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we apply all the well known styles and principles, the best we seem to be able to manage is the orange curve, which still has maintenance effort continuously increasing with an exponential factor.</p>

<h3 id="truethe-software-engineer-s-trap"><a class="anchor" href="#truethe-software-engineer-s-trap"></a>1.5. The software engineer&#8217;s trap</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typical bright young engineers come out of university knowing C++ or Java (or other C*, low-level, imperative, language that mimics the silicon), and are confident that, because the language is Turing-complete, if they string together enough statements, they can accomplish anything. At first they can. Agile methods only require them to deliver an increment of functionality. There hardly seems a need for a software architect to be involved. And besides, we are told that any design can emerge through incremental refactoring.</p>
</div>

<img src="images/Cynefin.jpg" alt="Cynefin.jpg">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. Code can quickly get complex</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the program gets larger, things are getting a little more complicated, but the young developer&#8217;s brain is still up to the task, not realizing he has already surpassed anyone else&#8217;s ability to read the code. He is still able to get more and more features working. One day the code suddenly 'transitions'. It transitions from the complicated quadrant into the complex quadrant. And now it is trapped there. It is too complex for the in-the-large refactoring that would be required to make it transition back. This pattern happens over and over again in almost all software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The incremental effort to maintain starts to eat away and eventually exceed the incremental increase in value. This now negative return causes the codebase itself to eventually lose value, until it is no longer an asset to the business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a new bright young engineer who knows C* arrives, he looks at the legacy codebase and is convinced that he can do better. And the cycle repeats. This is the CRAP cycle (Create, Repair, Abandon, rePlace). ALA is the only method I know that can prevent the CRAP cycle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="truea-short-history-of-ala"><a class="anchor" href="#truea-short-history-of-ala"></a>1.6. A short history of ALA</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From early on in my career, I experienced the CRAP cycle many times. Each time I wanted to find a way to not fall into it. I would research and use all the architectural styles and principles I could find. I would come across things like 'loose coupling', and I remember asking myself, yes but how does one accomplish that?, and still fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started searching for a pre-worked, generally applicable, 'template architecture' that would tell me what the organisation of the code should look like for any program. I searched for such a thing many times and never found one. Some would say that this is because the highest level structure depends on project specific requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Forty years worth of mistakes later, I finally have that template meta structure that all programs should have. The turning point was when I noticed two (accidental) successes in parts of two projects. These successes were only noticed years later, 15 years in one case and 5 years in the other. They had each undergone considerable maintenance during that time. But their simplicity had never degraded and their maintenance had always been straightforward. It was like being at a rubbish dump and noticing two pieces of metal that had never rusted. "That&#8217;s weird", you think to yourself. "What is going on here?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of them had the same functionality as another piece of software that I had written years earlier. That software was the worst I had ever written. It was truly a big ball of mud, and maintenance had become completely impossible, causing the whole product to be abandoned. So it wasn&#8217;t what the software did that made the difference between good and bad. It was how it was done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Analysing the common properties of those two code bases, gave clues that eventually resulted in a theoretical understanding of how to deal with complex systems. This meta-structure is what I now call Abstraction Layered Architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Subsequently, I ran some experiments to see if the maintainability and non-complexity could be predictably reproduced. These experiments, which have worked spectacularly well so far, are discussed as a project at the end of every chapter.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mastering all these topics takes time. Even if you can, juggling them all and being able to use the right ones at the right time is extremely taxing on any developer. Add to that the mastering of technologies and tools, keeping to agile sprint deadlines, and commitment to your team and management, it is an almost impossible task. 'Working code' tends to be what the team is judged on, especially by project managers or product owners who have no direct interest in architecture or even the Definition of Done. They don&#8217;t want to know about the rather negative sounding term, "technical debt".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA works by pre-solving most of these software engineering topics into a single 'meta-style'. This meta-style provides a simple set of architectural constraints.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being a pre-worked recipe of the aforementioned list of styles and patterns, ALA contains no truly novel ideas. Some ingredients are accentuated in importance more than you might expect (such as abstraction). Some are relatively neutral. Some are purposefully left out. The biggest surprise for me during the conception process of ALA was that some well-established software engineering memes seemed to be in conflict. Eventually I concluded that they were in-fact plain wrong. We will discuss these in detail one at a time in subsequent chapters. But to wet your appetite here is one meme that ALA definitely banishes to furtherest of evil kingdoms: the UML class diagram. Read on to find out why.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like any good recipe, the ingredients work together to form a whole that is greater than the sum of parts. The resulting code quality is significantly ahead of what the individual memes do by themselves. It continues to surprise me just how effective, and enjoyable, it is.</p>

<h3 id="truethe-first-few-strokes"><a class="anchor" href="#truethe-first-few-strokes"></a>1.8. The first few strokes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a software engineer contemplating a new project, I have often asked myself "Where do I start?" This also happens with legacy code, when contemplating the direction that refactorings should take. "If this software were structured optimally well, what would it look like?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Christopher Alexander, the creator of the idea of design patterns in building architecture, said, "As any designer will tell you, it is the first steps in a design process which count for the most. The first few strokes which create the form, carry within them the destiny of the rest". This has been my experience too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Agile, where architecture is meant to emerge, this wisdom has been lost. ALA restores that wisdom to software development, and gives the software architect the exact process to follow for that little piece of up-front design. No more than one sprint is required to do this architectural work, regardless of the size of the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, once this architectural work is done, the Agile process works significantly better thereafter. Furthermore, my experience over several projects so far is that the initial architecture does not need to change as the development proceeds.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section we describe the anatomy of the ALA structure without trying to explain too much about why it looks that way. That will be covered in Chapter three.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We describe it from several different perspectives. We all have different experiences or different prior knowledge on which we learn new ideas through comparison. So we will each have a different light that comes on. This chapter has about 10 different perspectives, some concrete, some high level, some analogies, and finally some in code. Don&#8217;t give up if most of them make no sense. Just use the best explains the insight for you.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="trueala-uses-just-one-relationship-type"><a class="anchor" href="#trueala-uses-just-one-relationship-type"></a>2.1. ALA uses just one relationship type</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA has a core fundamental premise from which everything else is derived. That premise is to use a single type of relationship:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/diagram-05a.png" alt="diagram 05a.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That relationship is "requires knowledge of to understand".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>B must be more abstract than A. "More abstract" means more general, not specific to A, have a greater scope of reuse than A. (For now just think of abstractions as synonymous with either classes or functions in conventional programming.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The relationship means that, to read and understand the code inside A, you must know the abstraction B - not how the insides of abstraction B work, just what B does, the concept. The word "abstraction" implies that it should be learnable in a short time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An example: A is an abstraction that calculates standard deviation. B is an abstraction that calculates squareroot. The code in A "requires knowledge of the [squareroot concept] to understand".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This "requires knowledge of to understand" relationship applies at design-time. So you can never use a relationship for run-time dependencies. And you can never break a module up into pieces arbitrarily, only pull out abstractions. From now on we will call this type of relationship a "knowledge dependency".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice how in the diagram the relationship arrow comes from inside A. It is only the code inside A that requires knowledge of the abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Architectures generally work by applying constraints. ALA&#8217;s constraint is that you have this one type of relationship. This fundamental constraint emerges all of ALA&#8217;s properties and patterns that we will explain in the rest of this chapter. A few of these these are:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>When data or events need to move from one part of a program to another, you can&#8217;t use a relationship to do it. Abstractions don&#8217;t know where their data comes from, nor where it goes. This implies using a concept of ports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the target of a knowledge dependency must be more abstract, abstractions arrange themselves into layers. This is what gives the architecture its name: Abstraction Layered Architecture. Because these dependencies have nothing to do with run-time dependencies, these layers are very different from the ones you might find in a conventional program that uses a layering pattern. Abstraction basically means reusable. As you go down the layers, abstraction increases and so does scope of reuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the target abstraction must be clearly more abstract, the abstraction layers form themselves into discrete levels. Only a small number of abstraction levels are needed. ALA generally uses four levels. The layers are given standard names that describe their level of abstraction, e.g. The Domain Abstractions layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA has zero coupling between the code inside all abstractions. Unfortunately there is a meme in the software engineering industry that there must be some coupling between software 'modules' if the system is to do anything. We hear of "loose coupling" as being the target ideal. This is completely incorrect. ALA uses zero coupling. In our A &amp; B example above, the code inside B knows nothing of A. The code inside A, while it knows about the concept of abstraction B, knows nothing about the code inside B. So we already know how to do zero-coupling. ALA just constrains us to do this all the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relationships are always represented simply by using the name of the abstraction (the same as you would use the name Sqrt). You would never use a line on a diagram to a box representing squareroot. And so it is that in ALA you never use a line or arrow in a diagram to use an abstraction (as we did with A and B above). This has the surprising consequence that a UML class diagram of an ALA program would have no lines or arrows at all. If drawn, it would consist of disconnected classes arranged in space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The knowledge dependency relationship differs from the UML class composition relationship, or any UML relationship for that matter. Although it is often implemented as a UML composition relationship (directed arrow with filled diamond), the meaning is far more constrained. It must be "requires knowledge of to understand". In the UML you can use associations for getting data at run-time, but in ALA you can&#8217;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A conventional program will typically have many many dependencies. They are there because data, messages, events, execution flow, etc, need to get from one place to another in the program. Or they are there because we have tried to separate responsibilities arbitrarily. None of these dependencies exist in an ALA program. The whole difficult concept of dependency management simply vanishes. So where do these relationships go? How can the program still work?  How is it possible for messages and events to travel around at run-time if there is absolute zero coupling? In later chapters we will go into detail on how this works, but for now, the short answer is that all these relationships become a line of code inside an abstraction in the layer above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In saying ALA has zero coupling, of course there may be leakage coupling. The quality of the abstractions is important. There is no such thing as black and white abstraction or not-abstraction. Abstraction quality is somewhat subjective, because they are for the human brain. For example, the code inside abstraction A could potentially tell how long B takes to execute. If it is sensitive to that, this is not a problem with ALA, but with the leaky abstraction. The design needs to be changed to eliminate the dependency on that leakage, or, if that is not possible, the coupling managed. But for the vast majority of code, the coupling between the insides of any two abstractions really is zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An abstraction&#8217;s implementation can consist of a group of artefacts: local variables, enums, function protoypes, interfaces, methods, classes, etc. These artefacts have high cohesion with one another. They are all considered the code for the one abstraction. They interconnect with each other, unconstrained. There are no dependency rules among them inside an abstraction. The only constraint ALA makes is that their total must be small - of the order of 100-500 lines of code. This applies to all abstractions, including the one that is the application itself in the top layer. Later we will discuss the forces that drive this optimal size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA has no concept of hierarchies or nesting. Abstractions cannot be contained by other abstractions. They are never nested. The reason they are never nested is simple. An abstraction being used must be more abstract than the abstraction using it. Therefore it must be outside the abstraction using it so it can be reused elsewhere. ALA uses abstraction layers instead of encapsulation hierarchies. In this respect abstractions differ from components in that a component can be a specific part of another component. In other words components can be completely contained (conceptually) by the component that uses it. Abstractions in ALA cannot be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstractions are the units of code in ALA. They are the only type of 'encapsulation' that works for our brains. Programming languages don&#8217;t support any concept that corresponds with this idea of an abstraction. So we need to improvise to create abstractions in code, even it can&#8217;t be understood as an abstraction by the compiler. Classes are the main way to implement most of an abstraction, but we need to add the concept of ports to them. Functions can be natural abstractions. (Note that namespaces are not encapsulations, and play no role except to make abstraction names unique). I usually use a source file to represent an abstraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the code inside an abstraction becomes too large, we factor out an abstraction. The factored out abstraction must be more abstract, and so not have any implicit coupling to the code it came from. It can know nothing of the specifics of the abstraction from which it was factored. It goes in a lower layer, where it can be reused. When the application itself gets too large, we look for abstractions that allow us to make our 'features' separated. For example, if we are building a weather station, we can make an abstraction out of the instance of the display area of the UI, and another for the menu. The different features, thermometer, anonomter etc, can then 'plug-in' to these abstractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the apparent simplicity of the "Standard deviation uses squareroot" example, the constraint of only being allowed to use knowledge dependencies is not trivial to do all of the time. But once the emergent programming paradigms and patterns are practised, it becomes relatively easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is one aspect of ALA that is hard to master - the invention of appropriate abstractions is relatively difficult. The reason why the "standard deviation uses squareroot" example seems easy is that the squareroot abstraction was already invented, and we know it so well. In ALA you will need to invent your own domain level abstractions. In other engineering disciplines, new abstractions come along only every few years, or hundreds of years sometimes. In software engineering, we have to do it every day in the first two weeks of a project in a new domain, and probably every iteration after that for a few iterations. But all whom I have taught how to do this have found it worth the effort, and all get much better at doing it. Working in the resulting zero-coupled code becomes a joy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effect of change to any one part of the program, whether in higher layers or lower ones, has greatly reduced ripple effects when compared with conventionally written programs. A ripple generally stops at an abstraction. And since all relationships are just uses of abstractions, ripples usually stay inside a single abstraction. Since abstractions are just concepts they are relatively stable. The quality of the abstractions is important however. The most common change that ripples outside of an abstraction is to make an abstraction more abstract to increase its versatility for greater reuse. This can usually be accomplished without breaking the existing abstraction interface (e.g. by adding optional parameters or properties).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know that ALA requires you to break up your entire application only by factoring out abstractions. So what does the application that&#8217;s left in the top layer look like when this is done? Well if anything abstract has been removed, what remains must be details specific only to this application. Essentially these details equate with the requirements. The application becomes just a formal expression of the requirements. There will be some information there that wasn&#8217;t perhaps explicitly stated in the requirements, but they were requirements none-the-less. For example, it may not have been stated that a sensor is connected to port 2. Perhaps unusually, an ALA application will have this detail in the very top layer, or at least in a one feature in the top layer (as a configuration parameter to an instance of an adc channel). Or it may not be stated in the requirements that a number displayed on the UI should not change its value frequently - it should be smoothed. So the application will end up with a filter wired into the data-flow. It is an emergent property of ALA that the application itself ends up being just a succinct, formal representation of the requirements. That specification of the requirements also happens to be executable.</p>

<h3 id="truecode-organisation-into-folders"><a class="anchor" href="#truecode-organisation-into-folders"></a>2.2. Code organisation into folders</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now a practical viewpoint of ALA - how it organises code into folders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am appalled when I see C programs with folders for .h files and folders for .c. .h files have close cohesion with .c files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you see an ALA application, you will find three to five folders that correspond with the abstraction layers (described in the previous section):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>StoryAbstractions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DomainAbstractions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ProgrammingParadigms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Library</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuing with the idea of knowledge dependencies, the class in the Application folder will have knowledge dependencies on the classes in the DomainAbstractions folder. In other words, you need to know what the classes in the DomainAbstractions folder do in order to read the application code. Similarly the classes in the DomainAbstractons folder have knowledge dependencies on the interfaces in the ProgrammingParadigms folder. There are no dependencies between classes within a folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There should also be a readme file that points to this website (or equivalent documentation). In ALA, we are explicit about what knowledge is needed before a given piece of code can be understood (knowledge dependencies). To understand an ALA application, you need a basic understanding of ALA (from this chapter). So that&#8217;s why there should be a readme file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Application folder, you will often find a diagram. This diagram describes the requirements. The diagram is 'complete' in that it describes all details of the requirements - it is not just an overview. The diagram is itself 'executable'. ALA is just a way of writing requirements that are executable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It should be quite easy to read the diagram as it only describes the requirements and does not involve itself with implementation. The boxes are instances of the DomainAbstractions (objects). The lines make a specific composition of instances. (Note that the lines in this diagram are not relationships between design-time artefacts. They are nothing more than equivalent to adjacent lines of code.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There should be a code file that exactly represents the diagram. It is generated from the diagram. So the diagram is the source. However, looking at this code file may clarify how the diagram is represented in code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every box in the diagram is an instance of one of the classes in the DomainAbstractions folder. These classes are called abstractions rather than modules or components because they have zero knowledge of each other and zero knowledge about the specific application. Their abstraction level is more general than the application, and so they are reusable within a domain. For now a domain can just mean your company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lines in the diagram represent connections using one of the interfaces from the ProgrammingParadigms folder. There is usually more than one interface, but no more than a few. Each represents a 'programming paradigm' such as event flow, data flow, a UI composition, or a schema relationship. The abstraction level of the ProgrammingParadigms folder is more general again than the DomainAbstractions - each paradigm should be useful for a type of computing problem in many different domains. This is the 'abstract interactions' pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This small set of interfaces allows instances of domain abstractions to be wired together in an infinite variety of ways - the property of composability.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="truehow-classes-are-used"><a class="anchor" href="#truehow-classes-are-used"></a>2.3. How classes are used</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is another practical viewpoint, this time on how classes are used in ALA programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, a class&#8217;s public interface (it&#8217;s public methods and properties) are only used to instantiate and configure the class. It is not used for anything the class actually does. The public interface is 'owned' by the class. It is specific to the configuration of that class. The public interface is only used from a class in a layer above. Only that layer knows what should be instantiated, how it should be configured, and how the instantiated objects are composed together to make a system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All other operations are done through interfaces. Class don&#8217;t 'own' these  interfaces. They are not specific to any one class. They are not about what any one class does, or needs. They are more general so that typically many different classes will implement/accept them. Objects of different classes can then be connected together using these more general interfaces in a variety of ways. The implication is that classes do not have association relationships. The lines that you would normally see dominating most UML class diagrams are completely absent if you drew a class diagram of an ALA application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA doesn&#8217;t need or use inheritance either. So the only relationship between classes is composition. If you drew a class diagram in ALA, you wouldn&#8217;t draw lines for composition. This is because you are composing abstractions. You wouldn&#8217;t draw a line to a square-root function every time you used it. It&#8217;s the same thing when using any abstraction. So it turns out that if you did try to draw a class diagram in ALA, it would have no lines at all. So there&#8217;s no point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any given class will typically implement/accept more than one of the generic interfaces. For the data-flow interfaces at least, think of them as I/O ports. This is the interface segregation principle, except that we do not refer to the other objects as clients. Only the class in the layer above (that uses the public interface) has the status of a client. The objects to which an object is wired are peers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In contrast to the previous two sections that talk about the use of folders and classes, this section gives the most abstract perspective we will use. I introduce it now because it is the one that gives ALA its name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This figure shows the abstraction layers:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. The four ALA layers</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first problem in understanding abstraction layers is understanding what abstraction means. Unfortunately the software industry has misused the word to the point where we get things upside down. This comes about because it sees hardware or alternatively the database at the bottom, and since hardware and databases are 'concrete', we argue are the least abstract. And so we build things on top of those that supposedly get more abstract. Whatever is at the very top, we argue, being the farthest away from the concrete silicon, must be the most abstract.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This thinking is completely wrong. We will look in depth at what 'abstract' means in a later section, but for now, just suspend everything you think you know about abstraction. In ALA we will say that 'more abstract' means 'more ubiquitous', 'more reusable' and 'more stable'. The application, at the top, is the least abstract. Also suspend everything you think you know about layers. In ALA, the hardware is never at the bottom. And neither is the database. Your programming language is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because this perspective probably doesn&#8217;t really connect with anything you already do, we will just list three key takeaway points from this section. These will become clearer later. In ALA:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The only dependencies you are allowed are on abstractions (shown as green arrows on the figure) and referred to as 'knowledge dependencies' or 'design-time dependencies' (as opposed to run-time dependencies).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first three abstraction layers are Application, Domain Abstractions, and Programming Paradigms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The layers get more abstract as you go down, and therefore more ubiquitous, more reusable, and more stable.</p>

<p>ALA is the bringing together of four important software engineering ideas. All are absolutely essential:</p>

<p>Abstraction</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I had just two minutes to explain what ALA is, this is the perspective I would use:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This perspective puts the focus on your input information - the requirements. ALA is a methodology that finds a way to directly describe requirements. It describes all the details in the requirements. Instead of having two artefacts, one for requirements capture and one for software source, ALA combines them as a single document and a single source of truth. BDD (Behavioural Driven Design) does something similar, but only achieves it for requirements and their tests. ALA goes one step further and makes the expressed requirements also the solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The description of the requirements itself has no implementation details. It just describes all details of requirements. The amount of code that describes requirements is typically about 2% of the entire application. When requirements change, you only need to change this 2%.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The description of the requirements is executable. Even though the description has no implementation details, it still executes directly. The expressed requirements is also the application.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="trueself-documenting-architecture"><a class="anchor" href="#trueself-documenting-architecture"></a>2.7. Self documenting architecture</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The executable description of requirements in the top layer is also the architecture or the design. (I do not make a distinction between architecture and design.) There is no separate artefact or documentation of the architecture, no model, no "high level" design. The same artefact that describes the requirements and is executable is also the application&#8217;s architecture. One source of truth for everything.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="truecreate-and-compose"><a class="anchor" href="#truecreate-and-compose"></a>2.8. Create and Compose</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I had ten minutes to explain what ALA is, this is the perspective I would use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common cliché for tackling complexity is "divide and conquer". Now here is a surprise. In ALA we do not divide and conquer. Instead we "Create and Compose".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are a few examples of composing:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When we write code in a general purpose programming language, we are composing with statements. Statements are low level (fine grained) elements and only support a single programming paradigm, which we could describe as 'imperative', but by composing instances of them in different ways we can create something. The structure is linear or a tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In functional programming, we are composing with functions, so the elements are higher level things that you create. But the programming paradigm is still imperative. The structure is linear or a tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When programming with monads, we are composing with amplified data types. These are usually low-level elements. But the programming paradigm has changed from imperative to data-flow. The structure is usually linear. (You don&#8217;t need to understand or use Monads to use ALA. however,
<a href="#Monads">See my method to understand Monads in Chapter Six</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When programming using the UML class diagram, we are composing high-level classes. The programming paradigm is associations. The syntax is graphical. The structure is a network.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When programming with XAML, we are composing with fundamental UI elements. The programming paradigm is UI layout.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s list the different properties present in these composition methods:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>low-level/high-level - A fixed set of fundamental elements versus elements that you can create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programming paradigm: The meaning of a composition relationship is fixed in each case. It can be Imperative, Data-flow, UI layout etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linear/Tree/Network: The structure built by the composition relationships can be linear, a tree structure or a general network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syntax: The syntax for the composition relationship can be using spaces, dots or boxes and lines and we can use various types of bracketing or indenting for the text form of tree structures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, we are setting up the top layer so we can do composition that</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Composes high-level elements that you create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows use of many programming paradigms, and allows new ones that you can create.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses the same syntax for all composition relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows linear, tree or network structures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA can therefore be described as 'generalised create and compose'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, compositions are 'instances of abstractions' 'connected' together in a specific way. This can be thought of as a graph. A graph is most easily imagined as a box and line drawing. In the common examples of composition that we mentioned above, sequential execution flow, monads, UI layout etc, the composition using text readily supports graphs that are linear or small tree structures. Arbitrary graph structures can usually be done by adding connections in a special way - by naming some of the nodes and then connecting by their identifier. However this method is somewhat inconvenient and unreadable in text form. ALA therefore can use diagrams to allow compositions to be arbitrary graphs. We are going to need that in any non-trivial application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To support generalised composition, ALA dedicates the top layer to the composition itself, a layer below it for the abstractions from which instances can be composed, and a layer below that for the different types of composition paradigms.
The middle layer is usually plain old classes and the bottom layer is usually plain old interfaces, although there are many other ways to do ALA.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An architecture based on decomposition into elements and their relations looks something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align: center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/Slide8.jpg" alt="Slide8.jpg">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. Decomposition into elements and their relations</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The figure shows five modules (or components) and their relations (as interactions). Study almost any piece of software, and this is what you will find (even if it adheres to the so-called layering pattern).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The structure generally can be viewed as 'clumping'. Like galaxies, certain areas have higher cohesion, and so go inside boxes. Other areas are more loosely coupled, and so are represented by lines between the boxes. The difference between high cohesion and loose coupling is only quantitative.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software health in this type of architecture is effectively management of the resulting coupling between the cohesive clumps. Allocate code to boxes in such a way as to minimize coupling. This coupling management has two conflicting forces. One is the need to have interactions to make the modules work as a system. The other is to minimize the interactions to keep the modules as loosely coupled as possible. As maintenance proceeds, the number of interactions inevitably increases, and the interfaces get fatter. The clumping is gradually eroded. Any so-called encapsulations become more or less transparent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various architectural styles are aimed at managing this conflict. Most notably:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>layering pattern</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MVC pattern</p>
</li>

<p>Avoid dependencies on unstable interfaces.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that none of this 'dependency management' actually avoids circular coupling. To some extent there will always be 'implicit coupling' in both directions between modules of a decomposed system. This is because the modules are the opposite of abstractions - specific 'parts' designed to interact and therefore collaborate. For example, a function of a decomposed system will tend to be written to do what its caller requires even if there is no explicit compile-time dependency on its caller. So circular coupling may be avoided at compile-time, but will still be present at design-time. That is why in the diagram above, couplings are drawn from the insides of each of the modules in both directions. This indicates that the code inside has some inherent design-time collaborative coupling. To the compiler or a dependency graphing tool, the lines may appear to be in one direction, and therefore 'layered', but it is not telling you the whole story of the coupling.</p>

<p>The word 'modules' has been changed to the word 'abstractions'. All the dependencies are gone. And with them all their problems, and all their management. The implicit coupling that we talked about earlier is also gone. It no longer has a 'clumping' structure. Loose coupling is replaced with zero coupling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The obvious question now is how can the system work? Where do all the  interactions between elements that we had before go? The answer is they become normal code, completely contained inside one additional abstraction:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interactions or collaboration should never be implemented in your abstractions. That just destroys them as abstractions. They are implemented inside another new abstraction at a different, more specific, abstraction level. Being contained inside that new abstraction the interactions are not coupling. They are just a composition of instances. They are cohesively together in one place where they belong because they are the specific information about the specific application. That small amount of code has all the knowledge about the specific application. The abstractions no longer know about the specific application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA overturns the conventional meme about decomposition into elements and their relations. It is unnecessary to write software that way. The only relationship that remains is the 'use of an abstraction'. This is, of course, a dependency but it is a good dependency. We will discuss from the point of view of good and bad dependencies in a later section. For now, dependencies are good if we want more of them. The more of them the better. For example if you have a library function or class, say squareroot, the more it is used the better, because the more useful the library function must have been. This type of dependency, the 'use of an abstraction', is the only one you need to build a system.</p>

<h3 id="truedsls"><a class="anchor" href="#truedsls"></a>2.10. DSLs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA&#8217;s succinct expression of requirements in the top layer sounds similar to the way requirements might be represented in a DSL (Domain Specific Language). Under the broader definition of a DSL, ALA&#8217;s domain abstractions layer is a DSL. But ALA is also different from a DSL. ALA, as its name suggests, is fundamentally about layering of abstractions. It layers them in a small number of layers, according to their abstraction level. When you do this, the top two layers emerge as the specific application and the domain. Therefore ALA happens to converge on the same solution as DSLs for these top two layers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In coming to this same solution from a different direction it has a different emphasis than a DSL has. It does not pursue the idea of an external DSL (new syntax), nor even the syntactic elegance of DSLs. It doesn&#8217;t move application development away from the developer as DSLs are often designed to do. You don&#8217;t get a different language such as XAML that a UI specialist designer can learn. These things may still be desirable qualities and ALA does not preclude them, it is just not what ALA is about. ALA says that just getting the abstraction layering right is enough to deal with complexity and maintainability.</p>
</div>

<p>As a DSL, in ALA you usually just wire together plain old objects, or functions in a way that is confined by a grammar. The classes (the domain abstractions) and the 3rd layer interfaces collectively form the DSL. The grammar is defined by which classes use which interfaces. This sets the rules for composition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the way, ALA also emerges other already discovered architectural styles such as CBE (Component Based Engineering), and composability. These are discussed later.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem in most large code bases is that the system structure, the in-the-large structure, is not explicit. It is distributed inside the modules themselves. If there is any collaboration between modules, it is implicitly hidden inside them. Finding this structure, even for a single user story can be time consuming. I have often spent a whole day doing that, doing countless all-files searches, just to change one line of code. Many developers I have spoken to can identify with this experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can get a lot worse as the system gets larger. In a bizarre twist, the more loosely coupled you make the elements, the harder it gets to trace a user story through them (because of the indirections). Some people conclude that loose coupling and being able to trace through a user-story are naturally in conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I call this situation SMITA (Structure Missing in the Action). This hidden structure is sometimes partially brought out as a model, a sort of high-level documentation of the internal structure. But such models are a secondary source of truth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA completely eliminates this problem and this conflict. The structure is explicitly coded in one place, without any indirections. Yet the abstractions are zero-coupled.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA we will often use a diagram instead of text for the source code in the application (top) layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Text is effective only when the relationships between instances of abstractions (words in the text) is a linear sequence or a relatively shallow tree (represented by indenting). If the relationships are an arbitrary graph or a deep tree, diagrams are far more effective. Becasue of this, part of what ALA is about is easily supporting programming with diagrams (sometimes called models, but I will avoid this ambiguous term). ALA diagrams show everything in an applciation, UI, event flow, dataflows, state machines, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a diagram is used, it is the 'source'. A code form of the diagram is generated from it for execution.</p>

<p>Here are two atom abstractions:

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If water was implemented in the same way we typically write software, there would be no water molecule per se; the oxygen atom would be modified to instantiate hydrogen atoms and interact with them. Even if dependency injection is used to avoid the instantiating, it is still unlikely that a water abstraction would be invented to do that, and there would still be the problem of the oxygen module being modified to interact with hydrogen&#8217;s specific interface. Either way, the oxygen module ends up with some implicit knowledge of hydrogen. And hydrogen probably ends up with some implicit knowledge of oxygen in providing what it needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This implicit knowledge is represented by the following diagram. The relationship is shown coming from the inner parts of the modules to represent implicit knowledge of each other.</p>

<p>While oxygen and hydrogen are modules, they are not abstractions because oxygen is implicitly tied to hydrogen and vice-versa. They can&#8217;t be used as building blocks for any other molecules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To keep oxygen as abstract as it is in the real world, an interface must be conceived that is even more abstract than oxygen or hydrogen. In the molecule world this is called a polar bond.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go round the circle once. We start with abstract parts such as cog wheels and hands. Instances of these have abstract interfaces that allow them to interact at run-time, such as spinning on axles and meshing teeth. The next step is to instantiate some of these abstractions and configure them. For example, configure the size and number of teeth of the cog wheels. Next comes the composition step, where they are assembled. Finally we have a new abstraction, the clock. Instances of them can be used to compose other things such as a scheduling things during your day, but that is a whole different abstraction.</p>

<p>Functions have an execution model we are already familiar with, making this first example easier to understand.

<p>Monads have allowed us to separate execution flow from composition flow. The composition flow in this case is the data-flow paradigm. Data will flow from the ADC to the display, so that is directly represented by the composition. How it executes is now separated out, but we will go into how that works shortly. Lets first understand the 'composition' and why this is so important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t understand how the monads work, you can see that syntactically the program is now very nice because all it does is compose instancesofabstarctions, and configure them with constants to be a thermometer. The composition is not declarative it is data-flow, because dataflow suits how to describe the thermometer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are using the word 'composition' here to mean the things we are joining together in adjacent lines of code. It can also mean joining boxes with lines in a diagram. Think of a composition as analogous to the adjacent notes in a music score, which are always played successively. If the lines of code are statements or function calls, we are composing things for successive synchronous execution by the CPU.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here we are composing for successive processing of data, or Data-flow composition. How it actually executes has been abstracted away and is handled separately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also notice that the first statement just builds the program. Then the second statement sets it running. This two stage aspect of monads is common in all the programming paradigms we will use in ALA. It is because the underlying execution flow is not the same as the flow of the program. We first wire it up, and then we tell it to 'execute'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The while loop code version we had above handled the data itself. Each function returned the data which was then passed into the next function. The monad code doesn&#8217;t do that. Instead, it creates and wires together objects which will, at run-time, send the data directly from one to another. This does not mean that the abstractions themselves know anything about each other - they are still zero coupled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly two paragraphs about how monads actually execute - the execution model. Don&#8217;t worry if this doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each function in the program statement (the function after each dot) executes once when the program starts. They are not executed when the program is running. Each of these functions first instantiates an object (using new), and secondly wires that object to the previous object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The functions wire the objects together using a common abstract interface. Common interfaces used for this type of programming paradigm are like IEnumerable or IObservable. These interfaces support iteration of data, what we call a stream. If using the IEnumerable interface, there is a simple method in the interface that pulls data from the previous object. If using the IObseravble interface, there is a simple method in the interface that pushes data to the next object.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Monads allowed us to compose using the data-flow programming paradigm. But what if we want to compose the UI? What if we want to compose the flow of navigation around an application? What if we want to compose transitions in a statemachine? ALA prescribes that we be able to do all this in the one application - whatever paradigms are the  best way to express the requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some instances of abstraction will need to take part in multiple paradigms, such as both UI and dataflow. When we boil down the description of our application to pure composition, our composition will often be a network. And when you have a network, your composition is best described by a diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To illustrate this let&#8217;s add some UI to our thermometer:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 8. Thermometer application complete with UI</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diagram has a UI composition as well. Once we have this diagram, it is easy to conceive how we might add features. For example, we could add a button into the UI, and wire it a switcher abstraction that changes between Celcius and faranheit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For UI part of the composition, the lines obviously don&#8217;t mean data-flow - they mean 'display inside'. So now different lines in our diagram have different meanings. Here is how that diagram is represented as text.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">application.c</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C"> void main()
 {
    FloatField temperature;

    program = new ADC()
        .WireIn(new Foreach())
        .wireIn(new OffsetAndScale(offset=4, slope=8.3))
        .wireIn(new Filter(10))
        .wireIn(new SampleEvery(100))
        .WireIn(new NumberToString()
        .wireIn(temperature = new FloatField());

    mainwindow = new Window()
       .wireTo(new Label("Temperture:"))
       .wireTo(temperature);

    mainwindow.Run();
 }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two programming paradigms here - the meaning of the wiring is data-flow in some parts, and UI layout in other parts. This is all done in the one cohesive piece of code that represents the thermometer application, and has all details which could be associated with the concept of a thermometer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The example projects in later chapter will use a range of different programming paradigms and consequently 'composition' will mean different things. Sometimes we will use custom programming paradigms - whatever allows us to describe those requirements in the best way.</p>

<h3 id="truecalculator"><a class="anchor" href="#truecalculator"></a>2.15. Calculator</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project came from a workshop on ALA. Apart from being a cool example of the use of ALA, the calculator itself is cool. This calculator is in Github, as a work in progress, so you can clone it or download it, run it, and look at any of the details of how it, or any of the domain abstractions work here: <a href="https://github.com/johnspray74/ReactiveCalculator">https://github.com/johnspray74/ReactiveCalculator</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The development was done in a hurry for the workshop, so here we tell the story of the development as well as how the calculator is designed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I was first asked to do the workshop, I needed to think of a suitable pedagogical sized project. It was suggested to me to do a calculator. Ok, I thought, if we have the domain abstractions in place, and a rehearsed application, we should be able to write a calculator application in a workshop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we think of a calculator application, we usually imagine a simulated version of a handheld calculator with a one line display and a keypad. We certainly could have built that calculator (primarily using a state machine programming paradigm). But that problem has already been solved by Miro Samek. Besides, such a calculator would be boring and useless.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an aside, I once had a love affair with HP calculators. The first programmable anything I ever owned was a calculator. I have owned many top end models at one time or another, and even own some SwissMicro modernized copies. But as their displays got larger, I became more and more disappointed with how they used that display real-estate. They just used it as a stack. The calculator I wanted shows the algebraic expression (formula) you used to get the result (so you can check what you did). You could edit the formula. You could label your formulas. You could use the result of one formula in another. When you change a formula or label, all results would be updated in situ. You could enter in RPN style but have it displayed in textbook or algebraic. The HP prime was the pinnacle of this disappointment. What a waste of space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I drew a sketch of what I thought the HP Prime should have been. Here is the actual sketch:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 10. Calculator screenshot</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step in the design of the calculator was to express the requirements (UI plus behaviours), inventing any needed abstractions to do so. Here is the actual first sketch:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/Calculator2Rows-HandDrawing.png" alt="Calculator2Rows-HandDrawing.png" width="900">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 11. Calculator (2 Rows only shown)</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we shall see, this diagram is practically executable code. The calculator is practically done. We don&#8217;t know if the invented domain abstractions will work yet, but let&#8217;s go through how this calculator works anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First notice how the entire calculator is here. Every detail about this particular calculator cohesively works together, so it all belongs together. This is an important aspect of ALA designs. All the UI and all the data flows to make a working calculator are in this one diagram. What is not here is the details we left to the domain abstractions. None of these abstractions is specific to a calculator. They can be used for all sorts of things. Even the Formula abstraction would be useful in any application where a calculation needs to be changed at run-time. For example an insurance application may need configurable calculations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The left side shows two instances of the abstraction, Horizontal. These arrange their children horizontally in the UI. To the left of those (not shown) is an instance of Vertical, which arranges the two Horizontals vertically. And to the left of that would be an instance of MainWindow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each Horizontal has 3 instances of TextBox and one Text. The TextBoxs allow you to enter a string. The abstraction, Text, can only display a string. I see at this point, I hadn&#8217;t put in the TextBox for the description.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="truehow-the-calculator-works"><a class="anchor" href="#truehow-the-calculator-works"></a>How the calculator works</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can ignore the use of labels for a moment and just enter a formula containing constants into the first row TextBox. Let&#8217;s say we type in "2+1". The string "2+1" goes along the data flow wire to the StringFormat instance on its port 0. The StringFormat is configured with the format string "({1}&#8658;{0})". StringFormat uses this format string in the same way as an interpolated string in C#. The {0} is substituted with the string coming in on port 0. The {1} is substituted with the string coming in on port 1. Since we have no string on port 1, the output from the StringFormat will be "()&#8658;2+1". This is simply a lambda expression with no parameters. This string is fed into the instance of Formula. Formula is an abstraction that knows how to evaluate a lambda expression. Actually it will accept just a formula (such as "2+1" as well). We can ignore the other input of Formula for the moment. Formula will evaluate "()&#8658;2+1" and produce the number 3 on its output. This output is a data-flow of type double. This number is fed to an instance of NumberToString, and from there it goes to the instance of Text that knows how to display a string.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s follow the use of labels in the calculator. Let&#8217;s put the labels "a" and "b" into the TextBoxs for labels on the two rows. "a" and "b" are fed to the Concat instance. Concat&#8217;s input port can have any number of string data-flows wired into it. In this diagram it has only two. What Concat does is concatenate all its inputs adding a separator. In this case the separator is configured to be a comma. The output of the Concat is "a,b". The concatenated list of labels is fed into port 1 of both StringFormat instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s put the formula "a*3" into the 2nd row of the calculator. The output of the StringFormat for that row will be "(a,b)&#8658;a*3". That lambda expression will be fed to the Formula instance, which will evaluate it, using the first value on its input port for the value of 'a'. The output will appear on the corresponding Text in the 2nd row.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So that&#8217;s all there is to understanding how the calculator works. At this point it takes a leap of faith that the abstractions can all be made to work, and that the two programming paradigms used, the UI layout and the data-flow, can be made to work. Not withstanding that, all the information required in the design of the calculator is captured.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point I drew little drawings of all the invented abstractions. Actually I reused TextBox, Text, Vertical, Horizontal and FormatString from a previous project. And I had already made the UI and data-flow programming paradigm interfaces in previous projects, so I reused them as well. Of course all those reused domain abstractions used those interfaces.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code in Concat is straightforward if you know C#, except for a few conventions which are to do with the use of ALA (which I was already proficient with):</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>We put a property "InstanceName" in every domain abstraction. It&#8217;s not required, but the reason is because abstraction get reused. So you are likely to end up with multiple instances of an abstraction all over your program. If you name the instances, it make debugging a lot easier because you can see it in the debugger and know which instance you are in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the IO for the abstraction is in a section called "Ports". Usually an abstraction would have some ports that are private fields of the type of an interface, and some that are an implemented interface. It just so happens that StringConcat has no implemented interface ports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two ports are private, and yet they get wired by the application code to other objects. This may seem a little bit magic. The reason they are private is to indicate they are not for use by anything else. The application will use a method called WireTo() to achieve the wiring. WireTo is an extension method on all objects. It uses reflection to find and assign to these "port" fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice that the "inputs" port uses IDataFlowB (not IDataflow). The B on IDataflowB indicates a tricky workaround for a limitation in the C# language. What we would have liked to do is implement IDatFlow. But we would have needed to implement IDataFlow multiple times. You can&#8217;t do that in C# (although there is no reason why not in theory, and hopefully all languages will have this feature to support the concept of ports one day).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice that the method, inputsPostWiringInitialze, is private and apparently unused. When the WireTo operation wires a port "xyz" it looks for a private method called xyzPostWiringInitialze and invokes it immediately. This gives us the opportunity to set up handlers on any events that may be in the interface. In this case, the IDataFlowB interface has a DataChanged event (that tells us when there is new data on the inputs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense to use a StringConcat without wiring its output to something. So the line "output.Data = result" will throw an exception if the application has not wired it. Often times, abstractions have ports that are optional to wire, in which case we would use "outputs?.Data = result"</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For reference, here is the IDataFlow interface, which lives in the ProgrammingParadigms folder, and is used by most of the domain abstractions including the StringConcat abstraction:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">IDataFlow.cs</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-C#" data-lang="C#">namespace ProgrammingParadigms
{
    public interface IDataFlow&lt;T&gt;
    {
        T Data { get; set; }
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, this interface is simple, but its importance in giving us a data-flow programming paradigm is huge. It allows objects to be wired together so that data can flow from object to object without the abstractions knowing anything about each other. Note that IDataflow uses a 'push' execution model. This means that the source always initiates the transfer of data on its output (by using 'set'). The IDataFlowB interface is a little more complicated, so we wont go into how it works just now. But it achieves exactly the same purpose of the data-flow programming paradigm, just in a different way that allows more than one input port of the same type. .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other domain abstraction I needed to write for the first time was Formula. Here is the template as used in Xmind:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/CalculatorFormulaTemplate.png" alt="CalculatorFormulaTemplate.png" width="500">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 14. Formula template</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once again, one of the input ports is shown on the right when we would prefer it to be on left.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Formula can be configured with an optional C# lambda expression when it is instantiated by the application, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Application.cs</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-C#" data-lang="C#">new Formula() {Lambda = (x,y) =&gt; x+y; }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If used in this way, the formula is fixed at design-time. But its real power comes from the fact that it can take a formula as a string at run-time. Formula has an input data-flow port called "formula".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Formula abstraction has to parse the formula string and then evaluate it. I used Roslyn to do this in a few lines of code. These lines of code took me a few hours to figure out however:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Formula.cs</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-C#" data-lang="C#">using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting;

{
    using LambdaType = Func&lt;double, double, double, double, double, double, double&gt;;

            {
                Lambda = await CSharpScript.EvaluateAsync&lt;LambdaType&gt;(formula, options);
            }
            catch (CompilationErrorException e)
            {
                Lambda = null;
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, currently the Formula abstraction can only handle formulas that use a maximum of six parameters. The calculator application can use any number - it&#8217;s just that any one formula is limited to using only six.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rest of the code in the Formula abstraction is mostly dealing with this requirement of exactly six parameters used by LambdaType. But that&#8217;s all internal to the abstraction. An instance of the Formula abstraction can handle any number of operands from zero to many. The Formula abstraction is also tolerant of the string on the formula input port being either just a formula such as "2*(3+1)" (implying it&#8217;s not using any operand inputs), or a proper lambda expression such as "(x,y,z)&#8658;x*(y+z).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have our needed domain abstractions, let&#8217;s return to the application layer, and see if we can get this calculator running.</p>

<p>Xmind is not the perfect tool to do this, but it has one huge advantage - it lays itself out. This is so important that it&#8217;s why we use it (until our new tool is ready). We will put up with the disadvantages, and the necessary conventions until then. Those conventions are documented in the wiki section of the project in Github here: <a href="https://github.com/johnspray74/ReactiveCalculator/wiki">https://github.com/johnspray74/ReactiveCalculator/wiki</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Entering the hand-drawn version of the diagram is a simple matter of copying and pasting the Xmind templates for the abstractions to the right place in the diagram. This connects most of the needed wiring from port to port. Xmind supports tree structured diagrams, so any cross tree wiring was done by using the red lines, which are quick to put in with cntrl-L.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Xmind version of the diagram is pretty much identical to the hand drawn version. The colored boxes are instances of abstractions. All the other nodes attached around the those colored boxes are the ports. The &lt; and &gt; signs in the ports are significant, and tell the automatic code generator which way to wire the instances. The asterisks are also significant, and tell the code generator that many wires can be wired to the one port.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diagram done, it&#8217;s time to generate the code. A tool called XmindParser does this. It can be downloaded from the Github project main page. Here is the tool in use to generate a calculator from the diagram.</p>

<p>Completing the diagram had taken another morning of work. But the calculator was now working and I was ready for the workshop.</p>

<p>So it was time to do some maintenance, and solve that problem of the repetition in the diagram at the same time. During this maintenance, none of the existing abstractions changed. Their ports stayed the same. Their internals were improved a little in some cases but nothing significant. Formula was modified internally so that it could handle more than six operand inputs, although any one formula can still only use six of them.</p>

<p>There were two major changes though. One was to put the repeated wiring for a calculator row inside its own abstraction. This abstraction is called "CalculatorRow". This abstraction is less abstract than the Domain abstractions it uses, but more abstract than the application, which will use it multiple times. Other version of the calculator alos reused it. So it goes into its own layer between the two. This new layer is called "Requirements Abstractions". We don&#8217;t make new layers lightly, but we had had the experience in a larger project that the diagram got too large. We needed to factor out some of it as 'Feature level abstractions'. These abstractions needed a new layer between the Application layer and the Domain abstractions layer. So I was reasonably happy to make use of this new layer in the calculator to reduce a now quite large diagram.</p>

<p>Here is the Xmind template for the CalculatorRow abstraction showing its ports:</p>

<p>At the time of writing I was transitioning from using Xmind to a new diagramming tool for ALA. This tool was in very early beta, so it does not route the cross-wiring around the boxes. However it did generate correct code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you implement an abstraction by an internal diagram, there needs to be some extra code to wire from the ports (shown in the template above) to the internal wiring. I found this code quite tricky the first time and it took me a while. But there is a pattern to it. The new tool will be able to automatically generate this code as well, but for now I did it by hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I tested the completed CalculatorRow abstraction by making an application that uses it twice:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 20. Calculator drawn in Xmind using the new CalculatorRow requirements abstraction</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because this test calculator has only two rows we can directly compare it with the 2-row calculator above and see how the two rows are now represented by two instances of this new CalculatorRow abstraction. However we are still not there to building a calculator with 10 rows. If we were to instantiate CalculatorRow 10 times, it would need 100 wirings in Xmind to connect all ten results to every rows input. Having thought the 36 wirings of the 6 row calculator was nuts, there was no way I was going to do 100 of them by hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the next step was to invent a domain abstraction called 'Multiple'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What 'Multiple' does is you instantiate it in your application and configure it with the number you want. In this case N:10. Multiple has a port called factory which uses a new interface called IFactory. Then what you do is add a small Factory class inside any abstraction that you want multiple instances of. In this case we want multiple instances of CalculatorRow, so I added a small class to that abstraction called CalculatorRowFactory. CalculatorRowFactory implements IFactory (which resides in the Programming Paradigms layer). Multiple can now create many instances of the abstraction that is wired to it. But these instances now have to be wired into the rest of the wiring in the application diagram as needed. To accomplish that, multiple is configured with two methods. These methods, which are part of the application, know how to wire the new instances into the rest of the wiring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the Xmind template for Multiple:</p>

<p>Using the new Multiple abstraction, we can now build a 10-row calculator. Here is the new diagram:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 22. Calculator drawn in Xmind using the new Multiple domain abstraction to create as many rows as we like</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see inside the instance of Multiple that it is configured to make 10 of whatever is attached to its factory port. The CalculatorRow abstraction is shown next to the CalculatorRowFactory so you can see what it makes. You can see inside Multiple the two methods that Multiple calls when it makes a new instance. These methods are used to wire the CalculatorRow into the rest of the application wiring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting to this point had taken another two Saturday mornings of work. It was mainly spent on thinking out the patterns for how the internal wiring inside CalculatorRow should get wired to CalculatorRows own border ports. Also in the initial attempt I had allowed temporal coupling to creep in between abstractions. It mattered whether the application wiring was done first. And if you let coupling creep in bugs will happen. The temporal coupling was resolved by making CalculatorRow not care whether or not the external wiring is done when it is instantiated.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if the calculator started with say 4 rows, and had a button for adding additional rows? You will notice that the Multiple abstraction template above has a port called addRow. It takes an IEvent. If it receives an event on that port at run-time, it will create another row and call the lambda wiring functions to get that row wired in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the calculator wiring with the button added to the UI. This is the calculator from which the screen shot shown above was taken.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 23. Later version of the calculator to support an unlimited number of rows</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wanted the Button to be at the bottom, so I added another instance of Vertical to act as the wiring point for new row to be attached to the UI. The output of the Button is another programming paradigm interface called an IEvent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the source code of IEvent:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">IEvent.cs</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-C#" data-lang="C#">namespace ProgrammingParadigms
{
    public interface IEvent
    {
        void Execute();
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, considering that this interface enables a whole programming paradigm, it is extremely simple and abstract, consisting of only a synchronous function call. It allows any objects that can produce events to be wired to any object that can receive event. In the CalculatorNRows example, it allows a Button to be Wired to a Multiple. When the Button is pressed, Multiple creates a new row.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one major Programming Paradigm that we have not explained yet. It is the one that allows UI instances to be wired together. The meaning of wiring two UI objects together is that one contains the other. Here is the IUI interface that implements this programming paradigm.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">IUI.cs</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-C#" data-lang="C#">using System.Windows;

namespace ProgrammingParadigms
{
    public interface IUI
    {
        UIElement GetWPFElement();
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interface simply allows a containing UI instance to get the WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) element from the contained UI instance it is wired to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Making Multiple able to add rows to the calculator at runtime took yet another Saturday morning. But it was worth it to solve the challenge of learning how to change the wiring at run-time. The wiring diagram now statically describes how it dynamically changes itself.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter we described what the structure, the anatomy, of ALA looks like as if we were dissecting a dead body. We see where things are but we don&#8217;t yet understand why they are there. In this chapter we explain why that structure works. Why does this way of organising code result in software that meets those non-functional requirements we listed in Chapter one?</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="truea-thought-experiment"><a class="anchor" href="#truea-thought-experiment"></a>3.1. A thought experiment</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine you are reading the following function, abc123, and trying to understand it:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>float abc123(float[])
{
    ...
    b = xyz789(a)
    ...

</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>float xyz789(float)
{
    ....
    // complicated code
    ....
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You don&#8217;t know what xyz789 is. It may as well be called fubar (fubar stands for messed up beyond all recognition), so you follow the indirection, an inconvenience at the least because you are really just wanting to understand abc123. You have to mentally stack where you were in abc123, including everything you understand about it so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You begin reading the code at xyz789. It only has about 20 lines but it is complicated. A comment mentions that it uses a CORDIC algorithm and gives a reference. But before following that indirection as well, you note that xyz789 has the following properties:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>a module</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>has a simple interface</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encapsulated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>uses nothing but what is in the interface</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no side effects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hides information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>probably separates two concerns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is small</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>follows the coding guidelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>has comments</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite having all these great properties that we are taught that all software should have, we are forced to read both functions to understand the code. They are effectively fully coupled - understanding the code involves understanding the total code in the two functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we will make a simple change that causes both functions to become abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>float StandardDeviation(float[])
{
    ...
    b = SQRT(a)
    ...
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>float Sqrt(float)
{
    // complicated code
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suddenly understandability is absolutely transformed! The code inside the each of the two functions goes from fully-coupled to zero-coupled.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the downward direction, coupling goes to zero because the standard deviation function need only know the concept of the squareroot abstraction, not the code inside it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the upward direction, coupling goes to zero because squareroot is more abstract and therefore can&#8217;t know anything about the more specific Standard deviation abstraction above it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are other benefits too:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Abstraction and stability go hand in hand. The Sqrt abstraction is as stable as the concept of squareroot. That&#8217;s a pretty stable concept. So, all dependencies in an ALA program are toward the more stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstraction and reuse go hand in hand (as poited out by Krueger). The more abstract abstraction on the bottom is reusable. Code reuse in this ALA programs increases markedly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The complicated code inside SQRT no longer matters. It is completely isolated by the abstraction. If your brain already knows the SQRT concept (I had to choose one that I knew you already knew), there is no need to follow the indirection when reading the code inside StandardDeviation. The reader just continues reading the next line of code after the Sqrt invocation as if Sqrt is just like any other line of code in their base language. That&#8217;s what abstraction does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All those other properties we listed above made no difference by themselves. That was because they all describe compile-time properties. They are still good to have, but they are insufficient. The abstraction property is the only one that works when our brain, and not the compiler, is reading the code. The quality of abstraction is subjective. Software engineers must invent good quality abstractions. No compiler or tool can check that quality, although, as Robert Martin points out, the number of reuses of an abstraction can be used as a measure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this new understanding, we will now define the word dependency to be compile-time relationships, and coupling to be the design-time or understanding-time relationships. One is what the compiler sees, the other is what our brain sees.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using these definitions, you can have coupling without dependencies (sometimes called implicit couling). But the reverse is also true - it is possible to have dependencies without any coupling. ALA makes use of this by simply making a constraint that we can only use this type of dependency. When you do that, every artefact (abstraction) in the program is zero-coupled with one-another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Doing this isn&#8217;t always easy because unfortunately there are many established architectural methods, patterns and styles that break this constraint. On the other hand, applying this constrain emerges some patterns that we will immediately recognise. DSLs and dependency injection are two examples. We will also emerge some less well known ones that are none-the-less not novel. There already exists an "abstract interfaces" pattern, for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two situations that commonly cause coupling:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In the above example, if xyz789 is just a source or destination for messages, then abc123 cannot be an abstraction because it cannot be reused without dragging xyz789 with it. abc123,as an abstraction, doesn&#8217;t care where the data comes from or goes to. To fix this, xyz789 must be passed into abc123 by something else above both of them. This can be passing in a function, passing in an object (dependency injection), or other mechanism such as the WireTo operator that we will use a lot in our ALA example projects.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A benefit over and above the zero coupling is that the data flow relationship between abc123 and xyz789 used be hidden inside abc123. In ALA that relationship has to be an explicit line of code (inside another abstraction above) that wires together two instances. There, it will be cohesive with other similar relationships that work together in a collaborative way to make the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often these collected together wirings form a graph, making diagrams rather than code an even better way to describe the application.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If xyz789 provides a part of the implementation of abc123 such that it is specific to abc123, then xyz789 is more specific than abc123. This is because abc123 could be reused many times, whereas xyz789 could only ever be used once (only by abc123). xyz789 needs to be more abstract than abc123 or it will be coupled to it.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is contrary to what we are taught. We are taught to "divide and conquer" or to separate out the responsibilities in abc123. If we do this arbitrarily, we will end up with specific pieces (such as UI and business logic) which are highly coupled with each other, and with the specific application. We need to work hard to separate only by finding abstractions - potentially reusable artefacts. Then we configure instances of those abstractions for each specific use by passing application details into them.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, ALA&#8217;s starting premise is a constraint. The constraint is that you can only use one type of dependency - a dependency on an abstraction that is more abstract. This results in zero coupling throughout the abstractions of the entire program.</p>

<p>The maintainability quality attribute is often thought of in terms of ripple effects of change. I don&#8217;t think that is quite the right way to look at it. I have often had to make changes across a number of modules in poorly written code. The changes themselves just don&#8217;t take that long. The problem I see is the time you have to spend understanding enough of the system to know where to make a change, even if it is one line of code. To make that small change with confidence that it wont break anything can take a long long time. The problem, in short is coupling. Even if the change is one line of code (which it often is), you may have had to understand a lot of code to figure that out. You have to understand all the code that is potentially coupled to that one line of code, which is essentially the complexity.</p>

<p>ALA makes abstraction and instances fundamental.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstractions are separate, zero coupled, design-time elements. Abstraction, therefore, cannot exchange data themselves. The concept of instances must be added. An instances is nothing more than the use of an abstraction by referring to its name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Object oriented programming does has these two concepts in classes and objects. Functional programming has the two concepts in terms of the function definition and the function invocation. But many discussions on software architecture seem to combine them into one term, such as modules, components or layers. They may implicitly contain the separate concepts, as components may, but not having them explicit will inevitably lead to confusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is that when we become vague about the difference, we will create dependencies, such as to get or put data, between abstractions that should just be using two instances in a line of code somewhere. Adding dependencies between abstractions destroy them as abstractions. Composing two Instances of abstractions does not. If we don&#8217;t have two separate and clear terms for abstractions and instances, we will end up with no abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nearly all architectural styles have this problem. For example, in layering, we put 'modules' into layers and then create unnecessary dependencies to move data between them. No, put abstractions into one layer. Then compose instances of them inside a new abstraction in the layer above to get the instances talking to each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another common example of the problem is the UML, which already has the separate concepts of objects and classes. But we tend to ignore objects and create associations between classes instead. The most important idea that OOP brought us was the idea of classes and objects. It has been ruined by the UML. Instead of associations between classes, instantiate objects and wire them together. Do that completely inside another class in the layer above.</p>

<p>We can distinguish two types of dependencies. One is run-time dependencies. These are dependencies in the code that are there because one module will need another module to be present at run-time for the system to work. The other is design-time dependencies. These are dependencies on the knowledge you must have to even understand a given piece of code. I will often refer to this type as a "knowledge dependency" or "use of an abstraction". It is also sometimes called "semantic coupling".</p>

<p>A simple example of a run-time dependency is a module that calculates the average rainfall then calls a display module to display the result. The Display module needs to be present at run-time. But to understand the code that calculates the average rainfall requires no knowledge about displays, nor even where the result will be sent. The dependency is only there to make the system work at run-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple example of a design-time knowledge dependency is some code that calculates the average rainfall. It uses an abstraction that takes a data stream as input and outputs a running average. To understand the rainfall code needs knowledge of averaging filter. This is a design-time, or knowledge dependency. Any application needing to reduce data to an average could use the same abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We find both types of dependencies in conventional code. A typical program is chock full of the run-time dependencies. But whether a knowledge dependency or a run-time dependency, they all just look like a function call or a 'new' keyword. We generally don&#8217;t distinguish between them. In fact we are not normally taught to tell the difference. They are all just called dependencies. We lump them together when we talk about dependency management, loose coupling, layering, fan-in &amp; fan-out, or circular dependencies. Dependency graphing tools just show them both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two different types of dependencies are not just good and bad. They are really good and really bad. So it&#8217;s doubly important that we learn to tell the difference. What&#8217;s more it&#8217;s entirely possible to build a system using only the good dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A knowledge dependency is good because it&#8217;s only dependent on an abstract concept. Abstractions are easy to learn. The more dependencies you have on an abstraction, the more abstract it is,and the more reuse you are getting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Run-time dependencies are bad because they completely destroy abstractions. They are bad because they cause explicit and implicit coupling. And they are bad because they obscure the structure of the application by distributing that structure throughout its modules. Instead, we want that structure to be explicit and in one place.</p>

<p>During code creation, run-time dependencies are easily introduced, and never seem too terrible at the time.

<p>The application level module either moves the data between the instances of A, B, C, D, E itself, or wires them together using the even more abstract interfaces, such as the one shown called IDataflow. These abstract interfaces are not specific to any of A, B, C, D or E. This is the abstract interactions pattern. The interface design is such that there could potentially be many abstractions that implement it or accept it, or both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If dependency injection is used, I prefer not to use XML for the explicit wiring. XML is not very readable, and it only handles tree structures. If you must use text, use normal code.

<p>When you are comparing the left and right sides of the table above, you may be wondering, where did the free lunch come from? Where did the runtime dependencies go? Is this some kind of magic? How can the program work without them? Or haven&#8217;t I just moved them somewhere else? No there are no tricks. The answer is that we have been taught to do programming in a very bad way. The knowledge that A will talk to B, B to C etc is there, but it is now in ordinary code, not as dependencies between anything. They are no longer dependencies because that code is fully contained in one place, inside a single new abstraction. Doing this makes a huge difference to any code. If you haven&#8217;t yet got your head around this, keep reading because we will present the same insight in other ways.</p>

<p>The code inside an abstraction in a higher layer makes use of an abstraction from a lower layer.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We call it a knowledge dependency because to understand the code in the higher layer, you must know about the abstraction. You don&#8217;t have to know about the details inside the abstraction, you just need to know about the abstraction. This is the way the world works and the way our brains have evolved to make sense of it. And it&#8217;s the way we need to structure our programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we write our programs using only knowledge dependencies, all the knowledge needed to understand a piece of code is explicit. It is right there in any function calls or new keywords. There is no knowledge needed from anywhere else, because there is no implicit coupling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, knowledge dependencies form the layers. There are no run-time dependencies present, so that is why the ALA layers are significantly different from the layers you would normally find in a program trying to use the layering pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bottom layer is your general purpose programming language. You must know its abstractions such as if-else statements before you can understand any layer above. You can generally learn this once for a whole career.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also need to know the next layer, which is at the abstraction level of programming paradigms. Examples are data-flow, state machines, database schemas, and UI trees. You would generally learn these as needed for different programming problems. A given domain will typically make use of several of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also need to know the next layer, the domain layer where you have useful building blocks for solving problems in a specific domain. You would learn these when you start a new job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally we come to the top layer. Its abstraction level is a single application. The abstraction is what the user sees - a tool that does a job by meeting a set of requirements. The abstraction level of the top layer is the details of the requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get the insight of ALA, you need to throw away any previous conceptions of layering you may have had as these will contain run-time dependencies. Think of run-time dependencies as just wiring in the top layer, tipped on its side.</p>

<h4 id="truestability-of-dependencies"><a class="anchor" href="#truestability-of-dependencies"></a>3.3.5. Stability of dependencies.</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because all dependencies used in ALA are just 'uses of abstractions', dependencies are always toward the more stable. Even if the implenetation details inside an abstraction change, the abstraction itself stays stable, because an abstraction is just an idea. ALA therefore naturally conforms with the Stable Dependencies Principle (depend in the direction of stability) and the Stable Abstractions Principle (Entities should be as abstract as they are stable).</p>

<h4 id="truedependency-fan-in-and-fan-out"><a class="anchor" href="#truedependency-fan-in-and-fan-out"></a>3.3.6. Dependency fan-in and fan-out</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the guidelines sometimes used for dependencies is that a class that has high fan-in should not have high fan-out. The argument goes that a class with high fan-in should have high stability but one with high fan-out would have low stability (presumably because dependencies are thought to be things that cause changes to propagate). Knowledge dependencies, becasue they are on abstractions do not have this property. An abstraction is something that insulates its dependants from its internal details. In ALA, it is perfectly fine, in fact really really good if a class in the middle layer can indeed have both high fan-in and high fan-out. It simply means that it is both useful to its users in higher layers, and making use of even more abstract things in lower layers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you think about your programming language as the bottom layer (on which everything depends), every reusable class you write has both high fan-in and high fan-out. This meme that not having high fan-in and high fan-out for the same class does not apply to knowledge dependencies. And if you apply it to run-time dependencies, what the meme should say is zero fan-in and zero fan-out.</p>

<h4 id="truecircular-dependencies"><a class="anchor" href="#truecircular-dependencies"></a>3.3.7. Circular dependencies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course in ALA, with only knowledge dependencies present in the system, and the abstraction layering being formed from them, you obviously cannot have circular knowledge dependencies. Nor would that even make sense. (Well actually it can make sense when we use knowledge recursion, in the same way that a mathematician might use recursion to define something. We will visit that in the last chapter.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since there are no run-time dependencies, the issue of circular dependencies with them does not arise at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But let&#8217;s just take look at the wiring that we create inside the application. (This is the wiring up of instances of abstractions to make a composition.) Can this wiring be circular? Yes it can, with the proviso that the execution model handles the execution of it in the way you intend. The execution model is a completely different story and is covered in the next section. In principle it is absolutely fine to have circular wiring. The electronics guys could not do without it - they call it feedback. And programs need it too. So why use a programming system that makes it awkward by constantly having to breaking the circle somewhere so there is no circle at at compile-time, but allowing the circle at run-time? ALA simply eliminates all that non-sense.</p>

<p>That concludes our discussion on why the ALA structure works from the point of view of good and bad dependencies.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="trueexpression-of-requirements"><a class="anchor" href="#trueexpression-of-requirements"></a>3.4. Expression of requirements</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have previously discussed this aspect of ALA in terms of structure. It is the top layer. And we have used this aspect as the starting point in the method to develop the example projects. But why does the succinct description of requirements in that top layer work?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In conventional software development, we typically break a user story (or feature or functional requirement) up into different implementation responsibilities. For example, layers like GUI, business logic and database, or a pattern such as MVC (Model, View, Controller). But a user story or feature actually starts out as cohesive knowledge n the requirements. And its not a huge amount of cohesive knowledge, so it doesn&#8217;t need breaking up. Cohesive knowledge, knowledge that is by its nature highly coupled within itself should be kept together. All we need to do to keep it together is find a way to describe it so that it is executable. Don&#8217;t try to do any implementation, just get it described in a concise and complete form. If you can do that, the chances are you will be able to find a way to make it execute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA we want to find a way to express the user story with about the same level of expressiveness as when the user story was explained in English by the product owner. The language he used would have contained domain specific terms to enable him to explain it concisely. The same thing ought to be possible in the code. Anything that does not come directly from the requirements and starts to look like implementation detail is separated out. It comes out into abstractions. These abstractions typically contain knowledge of how user stories in general are implemented - how things can be displayed, how things can be saved, how data can be processed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that abstractions that know how to implement useful things for expressing user stories are not only reusable for different user stories, but can be reusable for other applications. In other words, they are domain level abstractions. A typical user story might be composed of several of them, some to implement the user story&#8217;s UI, some to implement the user story&#8217;s business, and some to implement the user story&#8217;s saving of data. A user story instantiates the abstractions, configures them with the specific knowledge from the requirement, and then wires them together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most maintenance is probably changing, adding or fixing user stories or features. When those features are described entirely in one place instead of distributed through a lot of modules, you have a direct understanding of how the user story is represented by code, and therefore of how to change it or fix it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course application code makes heavy use, in fact is entirely composed of, instances of domain abstractions. When fixing a bug, it quickly becomes clear if the application code itself doesn&#8217;t represent the requirements as intended, or one of the abstractions is not doing its job properly. Again the maintenance is easy.</p>

<p>In decomposition methods, we are taught to decomposes the system into smaller elements or components with relations between them. Then decompose those into still smaller ones.

<h3 id="truediagrams-vs-text-2"><a class="anchor" href="#truediagrams-vs-text-2"></a>3.6. Diagrams vs text</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fundamental rules of ALA don&#8217;t prescribe the use of diagrams. But diagrams often emerge.
So why do we often use a diagram instead of text in the application (top) layer of an ALA application?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s because in any non-trivial program, there is structure inherent in the requirements that forms a graph. If you have UI that graph is a tree - still representable with indented text. But the UI must have connections. (These particular connections are often called bindings.) They need connections with data. They need connections with event handlers. These connections must be done symbolically if using text. The connections go further. There are connections to business logic and to some form of persistent data model, and from there to real databases or files. There are arbitrary connections for navigating around different pats of the UI. If text, most of these connections must be done symbolically. On the way, they may need to connect arbitrarily with things that process, reduce, or combine. There may be states involved, with arbitrary transitions needed between those states. There may be activities that have to happen in a prescribed time sequence, which by itself is representable as a linear instructions in text. But there are often loops or alternative routes through the sequence, which is representable as indented text. But then there is always some connection between the activities and some data or the outside world. If text, these connections must generally be done symbolically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these connections are inherent in the requirements. Like or not, they form a graph. And this graph structure is somewhere in your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we said, in text from, this graph needs to use at least some symbolic connections. That is, we can represent some of the graph with indenting and judicious use of anonymous functions or classes, but in general we will need to represent many of the connections by using names of variables, functions or objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is bad enough. In fact this is already really, really bad compared with how the electronics guys do things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it gets much worse. In most conventional code, we take all these symbolic connections and distribute them evenly through the files/modules/classes/functions. Now the graph is totally obfuscated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it gets much worse. Graphs have circles in them. There is nothing wrong with that, it&#8217;s inherent in the connections in the requirements. But circles are at odds with dependency rules. So now what we do is break the cyclic dependencies using principles like dependency inversion or observer pattern. When we do this we further obfuscate the graph. Some of the connections are done at run-time by code written somewhere else. This is the so called indirection problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What a mess we have got into!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA tells us how to fix this entire mess. It&#8217;s really quite simple. ALA breaks up your application by factoring out abstractions. When you have done that to the maximum extent, what&#8217;s left behind is nothing but the specifics of the requirements, including that graph.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can choose to go ahead and represent that graph in text in one place, using many symbolic connections, and you would already be way way better off than how we write conventional code. But even better is to do what the electronics guys do, and just build the tools to handle the graphs properly.</p>

<h4 id="truediagrams-and-text-are-not-equivalent"><a class="anchor" href="#truediagrams-and-text-are-not-equivalent"></a>3.6.1. Diagrams and text are not equivalent</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Diagrams and text are sometimes thought of as equivalent - and it&#8217;s a matter of personal preference which you use. I do not agree with this. From the point of view of how our brain&#8217;s work best, they are different, and each is powerful at its own job.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider an electronics engineer who uses a schematic diagram. Ask him to design a circuit using text and he will think you a simpleton. Electronics naturally has a network structure that is best viewed and reasoned about as a diagram. If you turn a diagram into a textual list of nodes and connections, the brain can no longer work with it directly. It is constantly interrupted to search for symbolic references when it should be free to just reason about the design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most software naturally has an arbitrary network structure. Think about whenever you are working with legacy code - how often to you need to do "all files searches" or "find all references". And even those are foiled by indirections. Try designing or reasoning about a state machine without using a diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Text can readily be used to compose elements in a linear chain or sequence. It is excellent for telling stories. White space is the normal connector between the elements. Sometimes periods or other symbols are used instead. Text can also handle shallow tree structures, simply by using indenting. Compilers may use brackets, usually () or {}. Interestingly, the brackets work for the compiler, but not for the brain. The brain doesn&#8217;t see them, it just sees the indenting. So I personally don&#8217;t agree that Python&#8217;s significant indenting is a mistake as many do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the tree gets deep, the indenting is too deep for our brains to follow. So text is only suitable for linear structures and shallow trees. Structured programming and XAML are examples of tree structured code represented successfully in text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Text becomes troublesome when there are arbitrary connections across the structure forming a mesh. It must be done with matching names, labels or identifiers. Most imperative programs are actually not a tree structure because of the variables. They must be done with labels. Local variables in a small scope are not too much of a problem. It only requires an editor that highlights all of them. For large scopes we end up spending too much time finding and trying to remember the connections, resorting to many all-files searches. It is a cumbersome way to try to reason about what is usually a simple structure when viewed as a diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(When we talk about labels, we are talking about labels that are used for connecting two or more points. These labels are not abstractions. References to the names of abstractions are absolutely fine, and we don&#8217;t draw lines for them even if we are using a diagram. We just use a box with the abstraction name inside it.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we need to compose instances of abstractions in an arbitrary network structure, our brains work much better using a diagram. The brain can readily see and follow the lines between the instances of the abstractions. Unlike with text labels, the lines are anonymous, as they should be. Lines don&#8217;t need encapsulation. To understand all uses of a variable in text, we need an encapsulation scope. To understand all places connected by a line, the brain just sees all the lines instead. Generally lines connect only two points or ports, but sometimes may connect three or four. More than that, and it starts to smell as if a new abstraction may be waiting to be discovered. The spacial positioning of elements is also something the brain readily remembers. So, diagrams can qualitatively do things that text simply cannot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA does not require a diagram per se. It only requires abstraction layering, and it&#8217;s quite possible for a user story to just consist of a linear sequence of abstracted operations. For example, a sequence of movements by a robot or a "Pipes and Filters" sequence of operations on data. However, ALA is polyglot with respect to programming paradigms because user stories will generally combine multiple programming paradigms: UI, event-flows, data-flows, state machines, data schemas, etc. These aspects of a user story tend to be naturally interrelated (inherent in the requirements), which is what causes the resulting relationships among its instances of abstractions to be a network. Diagrams, then, embrace the bringing together of all these different interrelationships of a user story in one place and view.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ALA design process (which is describing your requirements and inventing the needed abstractions as you go) is an intense diagram generating activity, especially the first time in a new domain. It requires all your focus. I have found that hand drawing the diagram on paper is not good. The diagram quickly gets into a messy state which requires redrawing, and that interrupts your flow. I have found that a diagramming tool that constantly needs you to control the layout, such as Visio, is also not good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So until there is a better tool, I have been using Xmind because as a mind-mapping tool, it is designed to not get in your way as you are creating. It lays itself out as a tree structure, and then allows cross connections on the tree to be added using a key short-cut at the source and a mouse click at the destination node. It has its limitations, however I use some simple conventions to get around these. For example, I use '&lt;' and '&gt;' to represent input and output ports.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, the tree structure allows easy hand translation of the diagram into indented, fluent style code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>More recently we use a simple tool that takes Xmind files and generates the code automatically.</p>

<pre>Thoughts on the essentials of a diagramming tool.

It would have the low driving overhead of a mind mapping tool. As with a mind-mapping tool, you control the logical layout, and the tool does the actual spacial positioning. It would primarily use keypresses, but allow mouse clicks where it makes sense, for example, to specify the destination of a 'cross connection'. The tool would route the cross conenction for you.

A tree topology can be done with simple key presses. The tree would capture the primary relationships between instances, on their main ports.

You can make mutiple trees for different user stories that are disconnected logically, but for the purpose of automatic layout, are connected to the main tree (just an invisible line).

Abstractions are defined in a separate panel as stand-alone boxes with ports. Once a new abstraction is  defined, it can be instantiated in the diagram by its abstraction name with auto completion. Boxes represent these instances of abstractions with the ports still lablled around their boundary.

The abstractions are fully inegrated with the classes in the code. This is in both directions. So for any existing classes, the IDE shows them with their port, and fully supports the entry of constructor arguments and properties.

In the other direction, if you create a new abstraction in the tool. You can specify its ports and their types and names. You can specify the constructor arguments and properties and their default values. It will create/modify a template for that class.cs.

The tool's purpose is to aid creativity in the ALA process of representing a user story, inventing new abstractions as you go. Of course the tool would also automatically generate the wiring code.</pre>

<p>In my experience, a low overhead drawing tool is essential during the iteration zero design phase and during subsequent maintenance.</p>

<h3 id="truecomposability-and-compositionality"><a class="anchor" href="#truecomposability-and-compositionality"></a>3.7. Composability and Compositionality</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have referred to the property "composability" a few times. By composability, we refer to the ability to create an infinite variety of applications by combining instances of a finite number of domain abstractions in different arrangements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a very important property in ALA. Composability uses the Principle of Compositionality which states: In mathematics, semantics, and philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jules Hedges says of this property "I claim that compositionality is extremely delicate, and that it is so powerful that it is worth going to extreme lengths to achieve it."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consequence of compositionality for software is that once a reader knows a finite number of abstractions, together with their rules of composition (grammar), they are able to understand a potentially infinite number of compositions, on first reading.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In software engineering, it is described by a pattern called "Abstract Interactions" or "Configurable Modularity" by Raoul de Campo and Nate Edwards - the ability to reuse independent components by changing their interconnections but not their internals. It is said that this characterises all successful reuse systems, and indeed all systems which can be described as "engineered".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA has these properties by using domain abstractions and programming paradigm interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are other software systems that have composability, usually using the data-flow paradigm, such RX (Reactive Extensions), or more generally monads. Most composability systems are restricted to a single paradigm. For ALA to have the correct level of expressiveness of all requirements, when inventing and composing domain abstractions, a variety of 'connection paradigms' are needed. Some examples of these are discussed in the next chapter on execution models.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can make an analogy with Lego bricks. Some Lego parts have the familiar little stud and tube connectors. Some will support axles and holes connections, either tight or loose. These different ways of connecting Lego parts are analogous to different programming paradigms and different ways for parts of the model to 'execute' at run-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the domain were for building model toys (the Lego domain), the non-ALA method would start with the imagined toy and decompose it into parts specific to that one toy. The solution would be brittle and hard to change and no other toys would be possible without the same huge effort all over again. The ALA method is to invent a finite set of building blocks and the mechanisms by which they connect. Then the initial toy can be easily changed, and other toys are possible with little effort.</p>

<h3 id="truesome-real-dependency-graphs"><a class="anchor" href="#truesome-real-dependency-graphs"></a>3.8. Some real dependency graphs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our example project for this chapter is a real legacy application (that was maintained for approximately 10 years) that we decided to re-write using ALA. Normally, for reasons I won&#8217;t go into here, I would never re-write an application. Maintenance had become difficult with this legacy code, and we wanted to run a research experiment to see if a rewrite using ALA could be successful. It would also give us a good basis for comparative metrics of the two code bases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original application has around 30 KLOC. Rather than look at any of the details of the application itself, we present here dependency graphs generated by Ndepend for the old legacy application and new ALA application.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="truelegacy-application-dependency-graphs"><a class="anchor" href="#truelegacy-application-dependency-graphs"></a>3.8.1. Legacy application dependency graphs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the core tenets of ALA (as discussed in Section 3.2) is "Composition using layers" instead of "Decomposition using encapsulation". Unfortunately Ndepend is designed with the assumption that the application should be built using the latter approach. It likes to present a decomposition structure, starting with assemblies (packages) at the outermost level, then namespaces, and then classes. I&#8217;m not sure why it considers namespaces a viable encapsulation mechanism because they don&#8217;t provide encapsulation. Anyway, here is the namespace dependency graph for the main assembly of the legacy version of the application, as it comes out of ndepend.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="images/old-datalink/namespaces.png"><img src="images/old-datalink/namespaces.png" alt="namespaces.png"></a>
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 27. Legacy application - namespaces</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This graph is quite large, so if you like you can right click on it, and open it in a new tab in your browser. The red arrows are dependencies in both directions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each box represents a namespace. The thickness of the arrows is proportional to the number fo dependencies. The size of the boxes is proportional to the number of lines of code in the namespace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we drill down into the largest namespace, UIForms, we see the class relationships between classes inside that namespace:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="images/old-datalink/classes-in-uiforms-namespace.png"><img src="images/old-datalink/classes-in-uiforms-namespace.png" alt="classes-in-uiforms-namespace.png"></a>
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 28. Legacy application - classes in uiforms namespace</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here you can see that ndepend is trying to make out the layers. The layers are vertical columns, going from left to right. I have left them vertical even through ALA abstraction layers are usually drawn horizontal because they come out more readable on the page. Again there are many dependencies in both directions drawn in red.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are the classes inside the DataStructure namespace:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="images/old-datalink/classes-in-datastructure-namespace.png"><img src="images/old-datalink/classes-in-datastructure-namespace.png" alt="classes-in-datastructure-namespace.png"></a>
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 29. Legacy application - classes in datastructure namespace</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, Ndepend is trying to make out the layers from left to right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one class called Device which actually looks like it might be a good abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned, namespaces provide no useful decomposition structure. They do not make abstractions in themselves, nor do they implement a facade pattern or an aggregate root type of pattern with even logical encapsulation. Any classes inside each namespace can have unconstrained relationships with any classes in any other namespace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So Ndepend is giving us a false picture here, because it is omitting all dependencies that go in or out of the namespaces. To really get an idea of what the big ball of mud looks like, I configured Ndepend to use a query that gives me all the classes in all the namespaces. Here finally is what this application truly looks like:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="images/old-datalink/classes-in-all-namespaces.png"><img src="images/old-datalink/classes-in-all-namespaces.png" alt="classes-in-all-namespaces.png"></a>
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 30. Legacy application - all classes in all namespaces</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This graph is very large. Right click on it, and open it in a new tab in your browser, so you can zoom in to see the dependencies in the background. It is truly frightening. Ndepend had no chance to find the dependency layers. There may be vaque onion type layers going outwards from the middle. It makes readily visible why continued maintenance on this application is so difficult. You have to read a lot of code to find even a tiny part of this hidden structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The developer who maintains the application tells me this is a fair projection of the complexity that he has to deal with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be fair, some of the dependencies in this diagram are 'good' dependencies (as described in Section 3.1 on good and bad dependencies). For example, the box near south-east called ScpProtocolManager has a lot of dependencies coming into it, which means it is possibly used a lot and therefore is a potential good abstraction. Ndepend does not know about the concept of good and bad dependencies, but if it did I would have it just display the bad ones.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ndepend has tried to find the three ALA layers which are vertical and go from left to right. Only the Application sits in the top layer. The DomainAbstractions layer contains the next two columns of classes and a few from the next column. And the ProgrammingParadigms layer contains the rest on the right. Actually there were a couple of bad dependencies present when this graph was generated which have since been fixed. (There should be no dependency between Panel and OptionBox, nor between Wizard and WizardItem.) With these removed, the graph would form into the three abstraction layers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The newly rewritten application is a work in progress at this point. However, as features are added, this is all the dependencies you will ever see. The Application already uses most of the domain abstractions we will ever need, and the domain abstractions already use the programming paradigm interfaces they need. There are a few DomainAbstractions to be added, but this is essentially what the  class dependency graph will look like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This graph has the classes from all namespaces. But just for interest, here is ndpend&#8217;s namespace dependency graph.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 32. New ALA application - namespaces</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember in ALA, we do not use decomposition, so namespaces do not represent decomposition of the system. They represent layers. You can clearly see the three layers. The wiring namespace also goes in the programmingparadigms layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s drill inside the domain abstraction namespace to see the interdependencies within that layer. We expect to see no dependencies:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 33. New ALA application - classes in DomainAbstractions namespace</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ok here we see the two previously mentioned bad dependencies, and two other dependencies. They are on delegates or enums in the same source file, and so don&#8217;t count as bad dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And finally, let&#8217;s drill into the ProgrammingParadigms namespace</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 34. New ALA application - Classes in Programming Paradigms namespace</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again we see a few dependencies on delegates in the same source file which are ok. There is a couple of connector classes that depend on interfaces in this same layer. I consider them part of the interface from the programming paradigm point of view. They are in the same source file as a cohesive unit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As of this writing, the new ALA version of the application is still a research project, but so far everything has gone smoothly with two weeks spent doing the description of the requirements as a diagram, and three months so far spent writing the domain abstractions. So far there are no issues getting it to actually execute. It is expected that we will actually commercialize the project soon and replace the old application.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="truethe-application-s-diagram"><a class="anchor" href="#truethe-application-s-diagram"></a>3.8.3. The application&#8217;s diagram</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we said in this chapter, diagrams can be an important aspect of ALA when the user story naturally contains a network of relationships among its instances of abstractions. In this application this is the case. There are UI relationships between elements of the UI. There are data-flow relationships between UI elements, data processing elements, and data sources. There are event-flows from UI to wizards and between wizards and the SaveFileBrowser. and there are minor data-flows such as a the filepath from the file browser to the csvFileReaderWriter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a sample section from the application diagram that shows all the relationships that implement the user story:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align: center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/DatalinkApplication.xmind.png" alt="DatalinkApplication.xmind.png">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 35. Xmind being used to design an application</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This diagram was drawn using Xmind. It shows a single user story.  There is a UI with a menu item or a tool bar to start the user story. It then displays a browse dialogue to specify the location of the file. When the filepath has been selected, it gets data off a device on a COM port, using a protocol, and writes it to a CSV file. The data is also routed to be shown on a grid on the UI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user story diagram makes use of four different programming paradigms (which become four different interface types). Firstly there is the UI structure consisting of the window with its menubar, grid etc arranged inside it. Secondly, there is an event connection for when the menu is clicked which opens the browse dialog. Thirdly a data-flow connection carries the output of the browse dialog, a string containing the selected filepath, to the CSVFileReaderWriter. Another data-flow connection carries characters between the COM port and the SCPProtocol and another carries SCPcommands from the SessionDataSCP. The forth programming paradigm is a table data flow that carries dynamic columns and rows of data from the SessionDataSCP object to the grid object in the UI and to the CSVFileReaderWriter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having drawn the diagram to represent the user story, we need to make the diagram execute. When we started this particular project we had no tool for automatically generating the code from the diagram, but during the project, one of the interns wrote a tool to do this. It parsed the Json output from Xmind and generated C# wiring code equivalent to what we will show below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, at first we were hand generating code, and it is instructive to know what this hand generated code looks like, just so we know how the diagram actually executes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we were hand generating the code, it was important that the code was readable from the point of view of seeing how it corresponds exactly with the diagram. (It wasn&#8217;t important that the code was readable from the point of view of seeing how the user story works - that was the job of the diagram.)  We had various conventions to support the one to one matching of diagram and code. One of these conventions was to indent the code to exactly mirror the tree structures in the diagram. Another was that whenever a new instance of an abstraction instantiated, all its ports would be wired immediately, and they would be wired in the order they were declared in the abstraction. This implies a depth first wiring strategy, analogous to walking the diagram tree depth first. Any ports with cross connections (the red lines in the diagram) would also be wired to their destinations at the time the abstraction were instantiated. If the destination instance did not already exist it would be pre-instantiated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using these conventions, it is a simple matter to hand generate the code below from the diagram.</p>

<h3 id="trueexample-project-coffee-machine"><a class="anchor" href="#trueexample-project-coffee-machine"></a>3.9. Example Project - Coffee machine</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Robert Martin posed an interesting pedagogical sized embedded system problem about a coffee maker in his book “Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns and Practices”. The original chapter is called “Heuristics and Coffee”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the original chapter, the worked solution to this problem uses decomposition into three modules that collaborate or interact with one another. The ALA solution follows the opposite philosophy. It has three abstractions (which correspond with the three modules), but they do not collaborate or interact with one another. Being abstractions, they don&#8217;t know anything about each other. As domain abstractions, they also know nothing about the coffee machine. The coffee machine is then constructed (as another abstraction in the top layer) that makes use of the three domain abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This example uses different execution models from the 'consistsof' and 'dataflow' ones that we used in previous examples. Here we will use some extremely simple, yet quite interesting electronic-signal-like execution models that have a simple main-loop polling type implementation, just as Robert Martin&#8217;s original solution also had.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reading an ALA application requires first knowing the pre-requisite knowledge you need from lower layer abstractions. So before presenting the application, let&#8217;s first familiarise ourselves with the abstractions we need from the domain layer, and the Programming Paradigms layer.</p>

<h4 id="truedomain-abstractions-layer"><a class="anchor" href="#truedomain-abstractions-layer"></a>3.9.1. Domain abstractions layer</h4>

<p>Here are the three domain abstractions:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take a moment to look at these three abstractions:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;The UI has a lamp you can control, and a push button which outputs an event (should have been two separate abstractions).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;There is a WarmerPlate. It tells you whether or not a container is on the warmer plate, and whether or not it is empty. It controls its own heater.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;There is a  Boiler. It can be turned on or off. It will tell you when it is empty of water. And you can stop water flow instantly with a steam release valve. It will turn its own heater off if it runs out of water, or the valve is opened.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s all there is to know about the three domain abstractions.</p>

<h4 id="trueapplication-layer"><a class="anchor" href="#trueapplication-layer"></a>3.9.3. Application layer</h4>

<p>Now that we have understood the knowledge dependencies in all lower layers, we can read the diagram that resides in the top layer, the application layer:</p>

<p>The diagram to the left is the application itself. Instances of the three domain abstractions, UI, Boiler and Warmer plate are shown as boxes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Follow me now as we go through the user stories by looking at the lines on the diagram:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the UI push button is pressed, we set the state to Brewing, provided the Boiler has water and the pot is on the Warmerplate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the state is brewing, it turns on the boiler, and coffee making starts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone takes the pot off, the valve is opened to momentarily release pressure from the boiling water, which stops the water flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the boiler becomes empty, the state is set to Brewed. When the state is Brewed, the light in the UI is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the coffee pot is replaced empty, the state goes back to the idle state where we began.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s all there is to reading this application. The code for the coffee machine can be read and understood in about one minute. Compare that with reading other solutions to the coffee machine problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the paragraph above is pretty much a restatement of the requirements in English. It could have been the requirements. The amount of information in the English form (or the diagram form) is about the same, thus the Domain Abstractions gave us the correct level of expressiveness. Further confirmation of this is if the level of expressiveness allows us to modify it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, say a requirement was added that a coin device was to enable the machine to be used. The coin device is an abstraction that provides an output when a coin is given, and has a reset input. Looking at the diagram, and being able to reason about its operation so easily, you can see that the coin device&#8217;s output would intercept the Pushbutton using another instance of an AND gate. And to reset the coin device, you could use the boiler empty output event.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="trueexecution"><a class="anchor" href="#trueexecution"></a>3.9.4. Execution</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make it actually execute, we apply the manual procedure documented in “Execution models.doc”. This document is in the Programming Paradigms layer. It will generate these 6 lines of code:</p>

<p>If you are using a diagram as we are in this solution, you always change the diagram first when the requirements change. It provides the expressiveness needed to see the application’s requirements represented in a clear, concise and coherent way. There the logic can be ‘reasoned’ with. It is not documentation, it is the source code representation of the requirements, and executable, both important aspects of ALA.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA fundamentally begins with the premise of abstraction layers, with each layer significantly more abstract than the one above. So it is interesting to observe how these layers seem to emerge typical usage patterns, which in turn give rise to their names: Application layer, Domain abstractions layer, Programming Paradigms layer, and so on.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The layer below the domain abstractions is really interesting in this respect. After the application has arranged and joined instances of domain abstractions to <em>represent user stories</em>, we now want them to actually execute. There are multiple ways things can execute:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>simple events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>data-flows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI layouts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>states machines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>data schemas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>functional programming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are all quite abstract concepts which suggests a new layer below. The domain abstractions need to use them extensively. So they make a new layer below the domain abstractions layer. Within the layer we will design interfaces for all these execution models so we will sometimes think of it as the execution models layer. But from the point of view of the application writer who is combining instances of abstractions, they look like programming paradigms. So we call the layer the "Programming Paradigms layer".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ways that programs can actually execute are by no means limited to the ones listed above. Slightly more custom ones such as "ConsistsOf" can be invented as needed (when they better express the requirements). We did this with the 'IConsistsOf' paradigm that we used in the project example for game scoring at the end of chapter two.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "programming paradigms" layer may also contain other abstractions useful for building domain abstractions, such as a 'Persistence' abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is an essential part of ALA to not only be able to have programming paradigms, but to use multiple programming paradigms in the same application, and in the same user story. This is referred to as polyglot programming paradigms. For most user stories, the most common paradigms needed are a combination of data-flow, UI layout, data schema and activity.</p>

<p>We will seldom make use of the 'imperative' programming paradigm - the execution model of the native CPU hardware and most so-called high-level languages. Imperative means sequential, synchronous, execution flow of instructions or statements. (This paradigm does have a place in algorithms, however.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some programmers are so used to thinking in terms of sequential synchronous execution that it can be difficult to think in terms of other programming paradigms. Or, you keep wanting to know what the equivalent sequential synchronous code is in order to understand what is going on under the covers, in terms of what you already understand. Instead it is better to let go and just think in terms of the new programming paradigms. Certainly it is nice to know what is going on under the covers from a performance or resourcing point of view. But from a logical point of view, it is better to start expressing requirements directly in a range of new programming paradigms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within each programming paradigm, there are generally some variations on how they can actually be made to execute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sections are a selection of some of the more common programming paradigms. It is not an exhaustive list. There are no doubt many other possibilities waiting to be invented that better allow succinct expression of requirements.</p>

<h3 id="truesynchronous-events"><a class="anchor" href="#truesynchronous-events"></a>4.2. Synchronous events</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We start with events because we want something that we can understand starting at the code level up. In this way we can get a concrete point of view of how these execution models can work. IEvent is the implementation of this simple yet very powerful and useful programming paradigm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>namespace ProgrammingParadigms
{
    public interface IEvent
    {
        void Execute();
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see the interface for this execution model is very simple indeed - it&#8217;s just a synchronous method call. Indeed it will be used to replace normal method calls between peer modules in conventional code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s complete our understanding at the code level by making two domain abstractions called A and B that use the interface:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>using ProgrammingParadigms


namespace DomainAbstractions
{

    class A
    {
        private IEvent Finished;

        public void Start()
        {
            // do my work
            Finsihed.Execute();
        }

    }



    class B : IEvent
    {
        IEvent Execute()
        {
            // do my work
        }
    }

}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we can write an application</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>using DomainAbstractions

class Application
{
    var program = new A().WireTo(new B());
    program.Start();
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will instantiate one instance of each of our domain abstractions, and wire them together. (If you have not seen the WireTo abstraction before, it is an extension method that uses reflection to search in class A for a private variable with a type that is an interface. It then sets it pointing to the instance of B if B implements the same interface. WireTo is not central to the current discussion, the IEvent interface is.  WireTo is discussed in more detail in the example projects of chapters 2 and 3.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite it&#8217;s simplicity, the IEvent interface is a powerful abstraction that has a huge impact on the quality of the architecture. The programming paradigm it gives us is, effectively, the UML Activity diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice just how abstract IEvent is. It&#8217;s highly reusable, it&#8217;s not specific to any domain abstraction or the application. It just knows how to transmit or receive an event. Because it is so abstract, it is stable. This makes it ok to have many domain abstractions depend on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many domain abstractions will use it, either by accepting the interface (as Class A does) or by implementing the interface (as Class B does). Then many instances of those domain abstractions can be connected together in an infinite variety of ways. This is called compositionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interface fully decouples domain abstractions, because they only have to know about this interface. They do not need to know about each other. Unlike normal method calls, senders don&#8217;t know who they are talking to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IEvent interface could be contrasted with the observer pattern (publish/subscribe) which also claims to achieve decoupling. However the observer pattern only reverses the dependency of a normal method call. Instead of the sender knowing about the receiver, the receiver has to know about the sender. If the sender and receivers are peers the observer pattern does not solve the problem. The IEvent interface decouples in both directions. The job of 'subscribing' is correctly moved to the application layer, because only the application should have the knowledge of what should be connected to what.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is normally a downside associated with decoupling, and that is that it becomes harder to follow the flow of control through the modules. That downside does not apply for the IEvent interface (or ALA in general). The reason is that the connections are still explicit - they are in the application layer that is wiring everything together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, the event driven programming paradigm used to connect instance of abstractions has the following properties over a conventional method call or observer pattern used between peer modules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These properties are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>sender decoupled from receiver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>receiver decoupled from sender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>connections between instances are still explicit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wiring is all brought to one place instead of being distributed inside modules</p>

<h3 id="truestate-machines"><a class="anchor" href="#truestate-machines"></a>4.3. State machines</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get used to how different these programming paradigms can be, let&#8217;s go now to something completely different - state machines. We wont be going into understanding them at the code level because we want to support hierarchical state machines, and the code for that is a little bit non-trivial, but we do want to get an understanding of how state machines are just another programming paradigm that allows us to wire together instance of abstractions. The meaning of the wiring is different than what it was for the event programming paradigm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I assume a basic understanding of what state machines are.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first it can be difficult to express the solution to a requirements problem as a state machine, even when the state machine is a suitable way to solve the problem. It takes some getting used to the first time. But it only takes a little bit of practice to begin to master it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I once had to express a set of user stories that involved different things that could happen from the outside, either through the UI or other inputs. I knew these were the kind of user stories that were nicely expressed by a state machine, but I had no idea where to start. I only knew that the previously written C code to do the job was a big mess that could no longer be maintained. But I started drawing the state machine, first on paper and then in Visio, and everything started to fall into place very nicely. Before I knew it I had represented what used to be 5000 lines of C code by a single A3 sized state machine diagram. This diagram so well represented the user stories that it was easy to maintain for years to come. This experience was a big factor in the final conception of ALA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the diagram.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 41. My first significant state machine for a real embedded device</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that the diagram makes heavy use of hierarchical states (boxes inside boxes). These turn out to be important in most of my state machines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>State machine diagrams are drawn in their own unique way. The boxes of the diagram are instances of the abstraction "State". The lines on a state machine diagram are actually instances of another abstraction, "Transition". Out of interest, to relate a state machine diagram to a more conventional ALA wiring diagram, you would replace all the lines on the state machine with boxes representing instances of Transition. The event, guard and actions that associate with a transition then go inside the transition box to configure it. Lines would then wire the transition box to its source state instance and destination state instance. Hierarchy is drawn on the state machine by boxes inside boxes, but in the conventional ALA wiring diagram, the boxes would be drawn outside with lines showing the tree structure. This analogous to the tree structured wiring we have used in previous examples for expressing UIs, which are actually 'contains' relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The graphical tool being developed will allow the drawing of hierarchical state machines. It will internally transform it to conventional wiring of instances of states and transitions. Interfaces called something like ITransitionSource, ITransitionDestination and IHiercharical would be used to make it execute. It is a simple matter to write code inside the state and transition abstractions to make them execute that would be adequately efficient for most purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How to make hierarchical state machine execute in an optimally efficient way is a non-trivial problem, but I have worked out the templates for what the C code should look like. Generating this code is a topic for another web page.</p>

<h3 id="trueimperative"><a class="anchor" href="#trueimperative"></a>4.4. Imperative</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have a bit of a feel for different types of programming paradigms, let&#8217;s cover the Imparative one, becasue it&#8217;s the one we all know and use all the time (when we shouldn&#8217;t).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imperative is the one provided by your programming language. It exists because it reflects the way the underlying machine works, not because it suits the expression of most user stories. Because it works the same way as the underlying machine, the imperative programming paradigm is efficient at runtime. This can be important for typically a small amount of the total code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Impareative means that connected elements are executed consecutively and synchronously as fast as the CPU can execute them. The connected elements are language statements, especially function or method calls. Functions and methods are executed 'synchronously', which means that execution is always passed with the messages. The receiver of a message gets both the message and the CPU resource to process it. The sender automatically waits until the receiver finishes using the CPU resource and returns it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The imperative paradigm is only suitable when you know ahead of time the order that things will happen, and those things should happen as fast as possible in CPU time. There is not real-time or temporal concerns other than having the entire routine execute as quickly as possible. It is the paradigm to use to execute short running algorithms.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="trueevent-driven"><a class="anchor" href="#trueevent-driven"></a>4.5. Event driven</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now return to 'Event driven' in the wider sense of the term than the synchronous event driven paradigm using the IEvent interface we discussed earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'Event driven' is an overloaded term in software engineering because it generally means both 'asynchronous' and 'decoupled'. Let&#8217;s clarify these two aspect separately.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="truecoupled-decoupled"><a class="anchor" href="#truecoupled-decoupled"></a>4.5.1. coupled/decoupled</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One perspective of 'Event Driven' is simply 'breaking out' of the imperative 'synchronous &amp; coupled' paradigm. In Imperative programming, function calls are  both synchronous (because the caller waits for it to return before continuing its own execution) and coupled (because the function caller refers directly to the function in another module or class by its name).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'Event driven' usually means both 'asynchronous' &amp; 'decoupled'. Asynchronous means the receiver of the message can handle the message in it&#8217;s own time. And the sender can do other things immediately. Decoupled means the sender does not name the recipient of the message. In most implementations if Event driven, the receiver usually names the event it is interested in. (Note that while this is considered 'decoupled' in Event Driven programming, it is not considered decoupled enough in ALA because the receiver (as an abstraction) still has to know about events in the outside world. In ALA we would use a fully decoupled implementation of the event driven programming paradigm.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two notions, synchronous/asynchronous and coupled/decoupled are actually independent of each other. All four combinations are possible, and sensible. In fact all four combinations can be used in ALA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we said, the term 'Event Driven' usually refers to the combination: asynchronous and decoupled, However in C#, events are synchronous and decoupled, which adds to the confusion. In C#, events are a synchronous implementation of the observer pattern - the sender waits until all receivers of the event have completed reacting to the event before continuing its own execution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="truesynchronous-asynchronous"><a class="anchor" href="#truesynchronous-asynchronous"></a>4.5.2. synchronous/asynchronous</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When something sends out an event or message there are two ways a receiver can get the message from a timing point of view.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Synchronous - the receiver processes the message immediately when the message is sent. The receiver must be waiting, doing nothing, ready to process the message. The time of processing is therefore said to be synchronised with the sender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous - The receiver processes the message in its own time some time later. The receiver may be busy doing other things in the meantime. This implies the message must be stored somewhere until the receiver is ready. The time of processing is not synchronised with the sending of the event.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So synchronous is made of an event plus the receiver in a do-nothing-wait state. Asynchronous is made up of an event, a storage of the event, and a receiver taking the event when it is ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="truerequest-response-pattern"><a class="anchor" href="#truerequest-response-pattern"></a>request/response pattern</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common pattern is an orchestration of two messages, a request and a response. Usually both messages are processed synchronously or both messages are processed asynchronously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When both messages are processed synchronously it creates a very common pattern which we know of as a function call or method call. This pattern is efficient when running on a single thread because it is directly supported in silicon by the  subroutine call instruction. This instruction passes the event and the execution CPU resource to the receiver at the same time, and passes them both back for the response at the same time. It is actually a very nice invention, and a very effective and safe pattern. However, because the synchronous function call or method call is so common in programming languages, and is so efficient, the synchronous request/response pattern appears to be fundamental to most developers and tends to be over used for messaging in situations where asynchronous messaging would be better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s unravelling when to use synchronous and when to use asynchronous.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="truereal-world-messaging"><a class="anchor" href="#truereal-world-messaging"></a>real world messaging</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the real world we don&#8217;t normally think about synchronous or asynchronous. If we are in a conversation, it is inherently synchronous. We naturally wait for the other person to stop talking, and then we talk. Synchronous can operate on slightly longer time scales as when go to the coffee machine and wait for the coffee. In synchronous, we may have to wait doing nothing at all for the receiver to be ready, as we do when we arrive for a doctors appointment. We basically do nothing until we are synchronised with the doctor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On longer time scales everything is naturally asynchronous. We send an event out. It could be a letter, an e-mail, or dropping off our car. We don&#8217;t wait, doing nothing, until the receiver is ready. We don&#8217;t wait, doing nothing, for the response. The receivers react to our events in their own time. In the meantime we can do other things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the response is not that important, like a request for a quote, the sender can simply never notice that there was no response. If it is important to get the response, like a payment of an invoice, the sender will generally time out if there is no response and then talk an alternative action. So timeouts frequently come into play with asynchronous messaging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now notice that asynchronous events or messages are the fundamental form. An asynchronous message can be processed synchronously, but not the other way around. When you are waiting for the coffee machine, you are actually able to do asynchronous, just currently operating synchronously. If someone comes and talks to you, you can switch to asynchronous, and pick up the waiting coffee when you are ready rather when it is ready. In ALA we will be making use of this fundamental property of messaging so that we can build abstractions without having to know whether the abstraction we are talking to wants to handle it asynchronously or synchronously.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="trueevent-driven-as-a-paradigm"><a class="anchor" href="#trueevent-driven-as-a-paradigm"></a>Event driven as a paradigm</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have discussed two properties of event driven: asynchronous and decoupled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Event Driven programming paradigm also has third meaning attached to it that is at higher level. In this context, the opposite of 'event driven' might be called 'Orchestration'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The orchestration paradigm will be covered in the Activity programming paradigm in the next section. For now it just means that our application will prescribe what will happen in what order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The event driven paradigm is the opposite. In the application we don&#8217;t know what will happen next (in either the outside world or what code will execute next). We will just wait until some event happens, and then react to it. Reacting to it usually changes some stored state. This state may change the way we will react to subsequent events. In other words, event driven and state machines work well together.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Event driven paradigm allows events external to the system to happen at any time. We may be bust processing a previous event, so these events must be asynchronous. Events sent between modules in the system may be either asynchronous (treated like external events) or synchronous (let&#8217;s do everything related to an external event now - called GALS - Globally Asynchronous locally synchronous) or a combination of both.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="truewhy-use-synchronous"><a class="anchor" href="#truewhy-use-synchronous"></a>Why use synchronous?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So if asynchronous is the more general and more flexible execution model, why use synchronous at all? As mentioned synchronous is efficient on a single thread, and is supported by the very common function or method statement of our common programming languages. These are sometimes good reasons to use synchronous. But there are other reasons to use synchronous locally.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Synchronous allows orchestration to be coded more conveniently. After a function call, the next thing to happen is coded in the next line of code, which is very nice. If using asynchronous messages for orchestration logic, the code for what happens next ends up in a different place (where the response event arrives) (although languages that have async/await can do code orchestration using asynchronous messaging just as nicely).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Single threaded synchronous messaging avoids certain potential problems because it is internally more deterministic - it orders the execution of everything that reacts to events. Asynchronous leaves the ordering of execution to be determined separately, which will generally appear less deterministic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="truewhy-use-asynchronous"><a class="anchor" href="#truewhy-use-asynchronous"></a>Why use asynchronous?</h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous avoids temporal coupling between sender and receiver. This can be hugely important, just as it&#8217;s important not to have to wait for the receiver to be ready read your email before you send it, or to have to wait all day doing nothing while your car is being fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous allows separate explicit (rather than implicit) scheduling of all work for temporal or performance issues. This explicit scheduling is both a greater freedom and a greater responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A synchronous thread can&#8217;t do anything else until it gets the response. This causes performance issues for long running routines. The connonical example is the UI that freezes while the single thread application executes a long synchronous algorithm. Synchronous generally involves temporal coupling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synchronous theoretically can work across threads, processors or networks (by remote procedure calls), but becomes even more problematic in temporal coupling. A synchronous call may block execution of the sender for an arbitrary length of time. The more general asynchronous approach becomes very much preferred.</p>

<h4 id="trueala-temporal-decoupling-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous"><a class="anchor" href="#trueala-temporal-decoupling-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous"></a>4.5.3. ALA temporal decoupling between synchronous and asynchronous</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA can use both asynchronous and synchronous. It does not have rules for when to use one or the other. The rules remain more or less the same as in non-ALA applications. However, ALA is all about abstractions that are completely uncoupled. They know absolutely nothing about each other, and this applies equally to whether they use asynchronous or synchronous events or messaging. It is therefore desirable that abstractions that generate events and abstractions that listen to events can be connected regardless of their synchronous or asynchronous nature. The only way to do this is for interfaces to be all asynchronous, and then be used synchronously when required at runtime. Let&#8217;s explore the consequences of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstractions that receive events can implement the asynchronous interface either asynchronously or synchronously as they choose. If implementing synchronously, if the interface uses a callback, this means that they will call the callback function in the interface synchronously. If Tasks or Promises are used in the interface, it means they will return a Task or Promise already in the complete state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstractions that send events can also use the asynchronous interface synchronously if they choose. To do they simply don&#8217;t do anything else until the response comes. If callbacks are used, it needn&#8217;t care if the callback is called back synchronously. If Tasks or Promises are used, it needn&#8217;t care if the Task or Promise it gets back after it sends the event is already in the complete state. But for when the receiver behaves asynchronously, the sender must still implement either a callback or a promise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this way senders and receivers do not need to be coupled with respect to synchronous/asynchronous. If two abstractions that don&#8217;t know each other are connected in the same processor, they can execute synchronously. If they are connected in over a network, they can communicate asynchronously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This all sounds good, but unfortunately, if you make an interface asynchronous in order for it to handle either asynchronous or synchronous, both ends must be written in the 'coding style' of asynchronous. If the sender wants to execute synchronously, the coding style looks awkward unless your language has async/await or a similar mechanism such as protothreads. This is especially true when there is a known sequence of activities to be done that is naturally expressed as sequential function calls. The other problem is that if you are in the happy position of having async/await available, the async functions can start spreading to everywhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the receiver side, when it wants to implement an asynchronous interface in a  synchronous manner, it can&#8217;t simply return the value - it must call the callback or set the result in the promise object first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All this only affects code that is written inside domain abstractions. It doesn&#8217;t affect things so much at the application layer. This is because in the application layer we have lifted ourself into the declarative realm of composition of instances of abstractions. We have abstracted away the execution model in the interfaces in the Programming Paradigms layer. If you are wanting to do something sequential (but not Imperative) in the application layer module, you do it using the 'Activity' execution model which we will describe in a later section of this chapter.</p>

==== Preemptive/non-premptive</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before leaving the 'Event Driven' execution model, we just need to clarify two variants of asynchronous - preemptive or non-preemptive. An Event or Message can be sent and end up being executed on another thread or the same thread.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, when using asynchronous, it must be non-pre-emptive by default. This is to prevent thread safety causing coupling between abstractions. Preemtive asynchronous (using multiple threads) would only be used when it is the only way to solve the temporal constraints of the problem, which would be understood to be compromising the decoupling between abstractions. This is the same criteria you should use in any type of programming style.</p>

<p>The name Activity-flow comes from the UML activity diagram. Activities that are wired together execute in order. One starts when the previous one finishes. The activity itself may take a long time to complete (without holding the CPU). Activity flows can split, run in parallel or pseudo-parallel and recombine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are languages or libraries that support the Activity paradigm in text form so that the code looks like the Imperative paradigm but is actually more of the Activity paradigm.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A data-flow model is a model in which wired instances in the program (or connected boxes on a diagram) are a path of data without being a path of execution-flow. The execution flow is like in another dimension relative to the data flow - it may go all over the place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A stream of data flows between the connected components. Each component processes data at its inputs and sends it out of its outputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each input and output can be operated in either push or pull mode. Usually the system prescribes all pull (LINQ), all push (RX), all inputs pull and outputs push (active objects with queues) or all outputs pull and inputs push (active connectors). In ALA we can use a mix of these different mechanism when we define the programming paradigm interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The network can be circular provided some kind of execution semantic finishes the underlying CPU execution at some point (see synchronous programming below).</p>

<p>This is the ALA equivalent of both IEnumerator and IObserver as used by monads. ALA uses the WireTo extension method that it already has to do the Bind operation.

<h4 id="trueglitches"><a class="anchor" href="#trueglitches"></a>4.7.4. Glitches</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All systems can have glitches when data flows are pushed in a diamond pattern. The diamond pattern occurs when an output is wired to two or more places, and then the outputs of those places eventually come back together. If they never come together, even both seen by a human, then we generally don&#8217;t care what order everything is executed in. But when they come together, the first input that arrives with new data will cause processing, and use old data on the other inputs. This unplanned combination of potentially inconsistent data processed together is a glitch. It even happens in electronic circuits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following composition of data-flow operators is meant to calculate (X+1)*(X+2)</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/diagram-25.png" alt="diagram 25.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When X changes, there can be a glitch, a short period of time, in which the output is (C<sub>new</sub>+1)*(C<sub>old</sub>+2).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In imperative programming, this problem is up to the developer to manage. He will usually arrange the order of execution and arrange for a single function or method to be called at the place where the data-paths come back together. As he does this, he is introducing a lot of non-obvious coupling indisde the modules of the system, which is one of the big problems with imperative programming.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we have composability, we don&#8217;t know inside the abstractions how data will propagate outside, and how it will arrive at its inputs. We want to execute whenever any of our inputs change, because as far as we know it may be the only change that might happen. So we really want the execution model to take care of eliminating glitches automatically for us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a work in progress for the IDataFlow execution model described above.
In the meantime, as a work-around I take care of it at the application level using a pattern. When I know data-flows will re-merge in a potentially inconsistent manner, I wire in an instance of an abstraction called 'Order' between the output and all its destination inputs. This instance of order is configured to explicitly control the order that the output date stream events are executed in. Then I will use a second abstraction called 'EventBlock' at the end of all data paths except one, the one that executes last.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default multiple IDataFlows wired to a single output are executed in the order that they are wired anyway. On the diagram, they are drawn top to bottom in that order.  This improves the determinism but is a little too implicit for my liking, so that is why I use the order abstraction.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of the word synchronous here is different from its use in the discussion of synchronous/asynchronous events above. Here it means a master system clock clocks the data around the system on regular ticks. At each tick, every instance latches its own inputs and then processes them and places the results on their outputs. Data progresses through one operator per tick, so takes more time to get through the system from inputs to outputs. The result is a more deterministic and mathematically analysable system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The execution timing and the timing of outputs occurs at a predictable tick time, albeit on a slower time scale than an asynchronous system. All timings are lifted into the normal design space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Glitches that could occur in an asynchronous system (discussed earlier) are eliminated at the level of single clock ticks. A fast glitch could not occur. A glitch would occur when different data paths had different lengths, and would last for at least one tick duration. Controlling glitches is therefore lifted into the normal design space.</p>

<p>The full source code for the bowling application can be viewed or downloaded from here: <a href="https://github.com/johnspray74/GameScoring">GameScoring code</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ten-pin bowling problem is a common coding kata. Usually the problem presented is just to return the total score, but in this example we will tackle the more complicated problem of keeping the score required for a real scorecard, which means we need to keep all the individual frame ball scores. We can afford to do this even for a pedagogical sized example because ALA can provide a simple enough solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/bowling_scorecard2.png" alt="bowling scorecard2.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ALA method starts by "describing the requirements in terms of abstractions that you invent". When we start describing the requirements of ten-pin bowling, we immediately find that "a game consists of multiple frames", and a "frame consists of multiple balls". Let&#8217;s invent an abstraction to express that. Let&#8217;s call it a "Frame". Instances of Frame can be wired together by a "ConsistsOf" relationship. So let&#8217;s invent an abstract interface to represent that, and call it 'IConsistsOf'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the diagram of what we have so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/diagram-bowling-1.png" alt="diagram bowling 1.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the first time we are using a diagram for an ALA application, so le&#8217;s go through the conventions used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name in the top of the boxes is the abstraction name. The name just beneath that is the name of an instance of the abstraction. For the bowling application above, we are using two instances of the Frame abstraction, one called "game" and one called "frame". Below the abstraction name and instance name go any configuration information of the instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Frame abstraction is configured with a lambda function to tell it when it is finished. The Frame abstraction works like this - when its last child is complete it will create a new one. It will stop doing that when the lambda expression is true. It will tell its parent it is complete when both the lambda expression is true and its last child Frame is complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The end of the chain is terminated with a leaf abstraction that also implements the 'IConsistsof' interface called 'SinglePlay'. It represents the most indivisible play of a game, which in bowling is one throw. Its job is to record the number of pins downed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept in the Frame abstraction is that at run-time it will form a composite pattern. As each down-stream child frame completes, a Frame will copy it to start a new one. This will form a tree structure. The "game" instance will end up with 10 "frames", and each frame instance will end up with 1, 2 or 3 SinglePlays.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note, in reference to the ALA layers, this diagram sits entirely in the top layer, the Application layer. The boxes are instances of abstractions that come from the second layer, the Domain Abstractions layer. The arrows are instances of the programming paradigm, 'InConsistsOf', which comes from the third layer, the ProgrammingParadigms layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This diagram will score 10 frames of ten-pin bowling but does not yet handle strikes and spares. So let&#8217;s do some 'maintenance' of our application. Because the application so far consists of simple abstractions, which are inherently stable, maintenance should be possible without changing these abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way a ten-pin bowling scorecard works, bonuses are scored in a different way for the first 9 frames than for the last frame. In the first nine frames, the bonus ball scores come from following frames, and just appear added to the frame&#8217;s total. They do no appear as explicit throws. In the last frame, they are shown as explicit throws on the scorecard. That is why there are up to 3 throws in that last frame.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To handle the different last frame, we just need to modify the completion lambda expression to this.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>frameNum&lt;9 &amp;&amp; (balls==2 || pins==10) // completion condition for frames 1..9
|| (balls==2 &amp;&amp; pins&lt;10 || balls==3) // completion condition for frame 10</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To handle bonuses for the first 9 frames, we introduce a new abstraction. Let&#8217;s call it Bonuses. Although we are inventing it first for the game of ten-pin bowling, it is important to think of it as a general purpose, potentially reusable abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What the Bonus abstraction does is, after its child frame completes, it continues adding plays to the score until its own lambda function returns true.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The completed ten-pin bowling scorer is this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/diagram-bowling-2.png" alt="diagram bowling 2.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the "game" instance (the left box of the diagram) implements IConsistsOf. This is where the outside world interfaces to this scoring engine. During a game, the number of pins knocked down by each throw is sent to this IConsistsOf interface. To get the score out, we would call a GetScore method in this interface.
The hard architectural work is done. We have invented abstractions to make it easy to express requirements. We have a diagram that describes the requirements. And the diagram is executable. All we have to do is put some implementation code inside those abstractions and the application will actually execute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First let&#8217;s turn the diagram into equivalent code. At the moment, there are no automated tools for converting such diagrams to code. But it is a simple matter to do it manually. We get the code below:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>private IConsistsOf game = new Frame("game")
    .setIsFrameCompleteLambda((gameNumber, frames, score) =&gt; frames==10)
    .WireTo(new Bonus("bonus")
        .setIsBonusesCompleteLambda((plays, score) =&gt; score&lt;10 || plays==3)
        .WireTo(new Frame("frame")
            .setIsFrameCompleteLambda((frameNumber, balls, pins) =&gt; frameNumber&lt;9 &amp;&amp; (balls==2 || pins[0]==10) || (balls==2 &amp;&amp; pins[0]&lt;10 || balls == 3))
            .WireTo(new SinglePlay("SinglePlay")
    )));</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All we have done is use the 'new' keyword for every box in the diagram. We have made the constructor take the instance name as a string. (This name is not used except to identify instances during debugging.) We use a method called "WireTo" for every line in the diagram. More on that in a minute. And we pass any optional configuration into the instances using setter methods. The WireTo method and the configuration setter methods all return the 'this' pointer, which allows us to write this code in fluent style. If you are not familiar with fluent style it is just making methods return the this reference, or another object, so that you can chain together method calls using dot operators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not all ALA applications will be put together using the method in the previous paragraph, but I have found it a fairly good way to do it for most of them, so we will see this same method used for other example projects to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, this has been a fairly top-down, waterfall-like approach. We have something that describes all the details of the requirements, but we haven&#8217;t considered implementation at all. Past experience tells us this may lead us into dangerous territory. Will the devil be in the details? Will the design have to change once we start implementing the abstractions? The first few times I did this, I was unsure. I was not even sure it could actually be made to work. The reason it does work is because of the way we have handled details. Firstly all details from requirements are in the diagram. The diagram is not an overview of the structure. It is the actual application. All other details, implementation details, are inside abstractions, where they are hidden even at design-time. Being inside abstractions isolates them from affecting anything else. So, it should now be a simple matter of writing classes for those three abstractions and the whole thing will come to life.
Implementing the three abstractions turns out to be straightforward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, design some methods for the IConsistOf interface that we think we will need to make the execution model work:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>    public interface IConsistsOf
    {
        void Ball(int score);
        bool IsComplete();
        int GetScore();
        int GetnPlays();
        IConsistsOf GetCopy(int frameNumber);
        List&lt;IConsistsOf&gt; GetSubFrames();
    }</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first four methods are fairly obvious. The Ball method receives the score on a play. The Complete, GetScore and GetnPlays methods return the state of the sub-part of the game. The GetCopy method asks the object to return a copy of itself (prototype pattern). When a child frame completes, we will call this to get another one. The GetSubFrames method is there to allow getting the scores from all the individual parts of the game as required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SinglePlay and Bonus abstractions are very straightforward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So let&#8217;s code the Frame abstraction.
Firstly, Frame both implements and accepts IConsistsOf. A field is needed to accept an IConsistsOf. The WireTo method will set this field:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>// Frame.cs
private IConsistsOf downstream;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frame has one 'state' variable which is the list of subframes. This is the composite pattern we referred to earlier, and what ends up forming the tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>// Frame.cs

private List&lt;IConsistsOf&gt; subFrames;
private readonly Func&lt;int, int, int, bool&gt; isFrameComplete;
private readonly int frameNumber = 0;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second variable is the lambda expression that is a configuration passed to us by the application. It would be readonly (immutable) except that I wanted to use a setter method to pass it in, not the constructor, to indicate it is optional.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third variable is the frameNumber, also immutable. It allows frame objects to know which child they are to their parent - e.g. 1st frame, 2nd frame etc. This value is passed to the lambda expression in case it wants to use it. For example, the lambda expression for a bowling frame needs to know if it is the last frame.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The methods of the IConsistsOf interface are now straightforward to write. Let&#8217;s go over a few of them to get the idea. Here is the most complicated of them, the Ball method:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>public void Ball(int player, int score)
{
    // 1. Check if our frame is complete, and do nothing
    // 2. See if our last subframe is complete, if so, start a new subframe
    // 3. Pass the ball score to all subframes

    if (IsComplete()) return;

    if (subFrames.Count==0 || subFrames.Last().IsComplete())
    {
        subFrames.Add(downstream.GetCopy(subFrames.Count));
    }

    foreach (IConsistsOf s in subFrames)
    {
        s.Ball(player, score);
    }
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It looks to see if the last child frame has completed, and if so starts a new child frame. Then it just passes on the ball score to all the child objects. Any that have completed will ignore it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IsComplete method checks two things: 1) that the last child object is complete and 2) that the lambda expression says we are complete:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>private bool IsComplete()
{
    if (subFrames.Count == 0) return false; // no plays yet
    return (subFrames.Last().IsComplete()) &amp;&amp;
        (isLambdaComplete == null ||
         isLambdaComplete(frameNumber, GetnPlays(), GetScore()));
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GetScore simply gets the sum of the scores of all the child objects:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>private int GetScore()
{
    return subFrames.Select(sf =&gt; sf.GetScore()).Sum();
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GetCopy method must make a copy of ourself. This is where the prototype pattern is used. This involves making a copy of our child as well. We will be given a new frameNumber by our parent.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>IConsistsOf GetCopy(int frameNumber)
{
    var gf = new Frame(frameNumber);
    gf.objectName = this.objectName;
    gf.subFrames = new List&lt;IConsistsOf&gt;();
    gf.downstream = downstream.GetCopy(0);
    gf.isLambdaComplete = this.isLambdaComplete;
    return gf as IConsistsOf;
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The few remaining methods of the IConsistOf interface are trivial. The implementation of IConsistsOf for the other two abstractions, SinglePlay and Bonuses, is similarly straightforward. Note that whereas Frame uses the composite pattern, Bonuses uses the decorator pattern. It implements and requires the IConsistsOf interface. The SinglePlay abstraction, being a leaf abstraction, only implements the IConsistsOf interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One method we haven&#8217;t discussed is the wireTo method that we used extensively in the application code to wire together instances of our domain abstractions. The wireTo method for Frame is shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>public Frame WireTo(IConsistsOf c)
{
    downstream = c;
    return this;
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This method does not need to be implemented in every domain abstraction. I use an extension method for WireTo. The WireTo extension method uses reflection to find the local variable to assign to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WireTo method will turn out to be useful in many ALA designs. Remember in ALA we "express requirements by composing instances of abstractions". If the 'instances' of 'abstractions' are implemented as 'objects' of 'classes', then we will use the wireTo method. If the 'instances' of 'abstractions' are 'invocations' of 'functions', as we did in the example project in Chapter One, we wont use WireTo obviously. In the coffeemaker example to come, 'instances' of 'abstractions' are 'references' to 'modules' because a given application would only have one of each abstraction.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s modify the bowling application to score tennis. If the bowling game hadn&#8217;t been implemented using ALA, you probably wouldn&#8217;t contemplate doing this. But ALA excels for maintainability, and I want to show that off by changing Bowling to Tennis. The Frame and IConsistsOf abstractions look like they could be pretty handy for Tennis. A match consists of sets, which consists of games, which consists of SinglePlays.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will need to make a small generalization to the Frame abstraction first. This will allow it to keep score for two players. We just change the type of the score from int to int[]. The Ball method will be generalised to take a player parameter to indicate which player won a play. A generalization of an abstraction to make it more reusable is a common operation in ALA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only other thing we will need to do is invent a new abstraction to convert a score such as 6,4 into a score like 1,0, because, for example, the winner of a game takes one point into the set score. This new abstraction is called WinnerTakesPoint (WTP in the diagram).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the tennis scoring game:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the diagram&#8217;s corresponding code:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>private IConsistsOf match = new Frame()
    .setIsFrameCompleteLambda((matchNumber, nSets, score) =&gt; score.Max()==3)

        .WireTo(new Frame()
            .setIsFrameCompleteLambda((setNumber, nGames, score) =&gt; score.Max()&gt;=6 &amp;&amp; Math.Abs(score[0]-score[1])&gt;=2)

                .WireTo(new Frame()
                    .setIsFrameCompleteLambda((gameNumber, nBalls, score) =&gt; score.Max()&gt;=4 &amp;&amp; Math.Abs(score[0]-score[1])&gt;=2)
                    .WireTo(new SinglePlay()))))));</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new WinnerTakesPoint abstraction is easy to write. It is a decorator that implements and requires the IConsistsOf interface. Most methods pass through except the GetScore, which returns 0,0 until the down-stream object completes, then it returns either 1,0 or 0,1 depending on which player has the higher score.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s switch our attention back to another example of maintenance. Let&#8217;s add the tiebreak feature. Another instance of Frame will score the tiebreak quite nicely. However we will need an abstraction that can switch us from playing the set to the tie break. Let&#8217;s call it Switch, and give it a lambda function to configure it with when to switch from one subframe tree to another. Switch simply returns the sum of scores of its two subtrees.

<p>Notice that I have added string names to the instances of Frame and other objects. This is not required to make the program function, but generally is a good habit to get into in ALA. It is because in ALA we typically use multiple instances of abstractions in different parts of the program. The names give us a way of identifying the different instances during any debugging. Using them I can Console.Writeline debugging information along with the object&#8217;s name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Around 8 lines of code express the rules of ten-pin bowling and around 15 lines of code express the rules of tennis. That sounds about right for the inherent complexity of the two games. The two rule descriptions actually execute and pass a large battery of tests.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The domain abstractions are zero-coupled with one another, and are each straightforward to write by just implementing the methods of the IConsistOf interface according to what the abstraction does. The abstractions are simple and stable. So no part of the program is more complex than its own local part.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The domain abstractions are reusable in the domain of game scoring. And, my experience was that as the details inside the abstractions were implemented, the application design didn&#8217;t have to change.</p>

<p>To show the decreasing maintenance effort. The Tennis game was done easily because it reused domain building blocks we had already created for bowling.</p>

<p>To emphasis where all the details of the requirements end up. The only difference between the bowling and tennis applications is the two diagrams, which are translated into two code files: bowling.cs and tennis.cs of 8 lines and 15 lines respectively. These two files completely express the detailed requirements of their respective games. No other source files have any knowledge of these specific games. Furthermore, Bowling.cs and Tennis.cs do not do anything other than express requirements. All implementation to actually make it execute is hidden in domain abstractions and programming paradigm abstractions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA is inherently optimally agile (except for an Iteration zero which we will discuss next). By optimally agile, we mean that the amount of code that changes to change functional requirements is the minimum it can be. The amount of code that actuall depends on requirements is a small percentage of the total. This differs from the average application where most code depends on the requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA achieves this at its first level of separation of concerns. This first  separation is to separate code that will just describe requirements from code that will implementation the abstractions needed to describe the requirements. This implementation code never has knowledge of any requirements, so it generally doesn&#8217;t change when requirements change. Only the code that describes requirements needs to change, and that code is optimally minimal.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="trueiteration-zero"><a class="anchor" href="#trueiteration-zero"></a>5.1.1. Iteration zero</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a new project begins, the only new information we have is the requirements. Any design decisions that don’t depend on the specific requirements could already have been made beforehand. It is those decisions that form the ALA reference architecture. Therefore, when we get the requirements, that is our immediate and total focus. We may not know all of them, but we will only need a sample to build start inventing our domain abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking at the available new information as a whole first instead of taking it a bit at a time during the project&#8217;s sprints will make a huge difference to the quality of the abstractions we invent, and eventually the quality of the application&#8217;s architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process in the first iteration takes requirements one by one, and represents them, in all their detail. Domain abstractions will be invented as you go, and they will have parameters or properties that will handle those details from requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the first green field application, you spend a maximum of one sprint. After that you do need to find out if your design works. So you may not get through all the known requirements. That does not matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To know whether knowledge from your design goes in the application layer or the domain abstractions layers, you consider what the scope of that knowledge is. Is the knowledge specific to this one requirement in the one application, or is it potentially reusable in the same or other applications? A softkey label is clearly specific and goes in the application. The concept of softkeys is clearly a domain abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output of the first sprint does not implement any of the invented abstractions, but it does include all details of the requirements that are looked at. In so doing, you design the first approximation of a DSL. The DSL may be refined later as more requirements are looked at.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each abstraction will eventually be implemented as a class, but initially we just record the names of the abstractions, and a short explanation that provides the insight into what the abstraction does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the end of the first sprint the requirements will have become easier and easier to represent, as the set of abstractions will have taken shape. Sometimes you will generalise an abstraction further to enable it to be useful in more parts of the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By keeping moving through the requirements at a much faster pace than in normal development (say one feature per hour instead of one per week), we can keep representing them in a coherent way, revising abstraction ideas we have already invented. Ideally, we will end up with a set of domain abstractions that can be wired together in different ways to represent the requirement space - the space of all possible requirements. That space, which we call the domain, will grow slightly as time goes on and it accommodates a growing family of products, but we don’t want it to grow beyond that. We don’t want to invent ways of implementing things we will never do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, we do want to invent quite a few abstractions during this first iterations so that we end up with a coherent set of them that will compose together in an infinite variety of ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output of sprint zero is usually a diagram showing the wiring of instances of abstractions, together with configuration information for those instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It doesn’t matter if some of the requirements are wrong. Chances are they are still useful for scoping out the domain space. What we are actually producing in this phase are the necessary abstractions for the Domain Abstractions layer. If the requirements change later, it will be trivially simple to change them as only the Application layer wiring should change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once this process has started to become easy, which should happen within the first sprint, the burning question in our minds will become “Will all this actually work?” We have to trust that there will be a way to write those abstractions to make the whole system execute.</p>

<h4 id="truehow-to-invent-domain-abstractions"><a class="anchor" href="#truehow-to-invent-domain-abstractions"></a>5.1.2. How to invent Domain Abstractions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most difficult part for people new to ALA is the skill of inventing the domain abstractions. You can fully understand the theory of ALA and why we need to invent abstractions, and still find it tricky to actually invent them. That&#8217;s because in this step in the process, we have to literally become inventors who are adding to the state of the art within your domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the biggest insight I can offer here is don&#8217;t expect it to come without effort. Put your inventors hat on. Deliberate about the problem over a long period of time. Leave it overnight. Come back to it afresh in a week. Be patient.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I sometimes find that a solution will pop out of nowhere while reading about something completely unrelated. Once the human mind has been deliberating for some time, it remembers the whole context of the problem, and seems to carry on pattern matching for potential solutions in the background. I am reminded of the story of the Dam Busters. The British wanted to bomb the German dams to flood the industrial valleys below them. They worked out that they could deliver the bombs to the face of dam by skipping them across the surface of the lake. But they couldn&#8217;t get their bomber low enough to the water at night to get them to skip, because they had no way of knowing their height above the water.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then one of the pilots was attending a play. He saw the spotlights pointing at the actor from different angles. And suddenly he had the solution. By mounting spotlights at the nose and the tail of the aircraft at a certain angle, they would know when they were at the correct height when the two spots came together at the surface of the water.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my experience, there is always a solution, and it is always worth the effort. Just as good inventions are like gold, good abstractions are like gold in your application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section offers some practical tips on where to start.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You start by simply expressing requirements. You are inventing domain abstractions to allow you to express the requirements succinctly, but including all their details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draw a diagram that describes the requirements. You will draw boxes with lines. The boxes are your invented domain abstractions. The lines are your invented programming paradigms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at the English version of the requirements for words that recur. These are candidates for abstractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your diagram should have about the same amount of information as the English requirements. It will be succinct, even though it will include lots of detail such as text strings that come from requirements. Anything else that even begins to look like implementation or how it will work or execute is the beginning of an idea for an abstraction. Don&#8217;t worry about them. Just concentrate on making a description of requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always keep in mind that reusability and abstraction are two sides of the same coin. Your invented abstractions are anything that is potentially reusable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start with the user interface. Sketch multiple parts of the UI to make it more concrete. Then it is relatively easy to invent abstractions for your UI. They are things that will recur in different parts of the UI that you will always want to be done the same way. We can draw inspiration from the many widgets we already find in UI frameworks. ALA will often have equivalent ones that are just a little more specialised to your domain. Buttons may have a consistent size and style in your domain. Or your domain may need Softkeys, which are not usually part of a UI framework.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA UI abstractions will usually be composed together in a tree structure representing the containment structure. This is similar to the tree structure of XAML, but in ALA we will usually do it as a diagram that is just one part of the entire application diagram.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you have designed some UI, you will then want to connect the UI elements that display data to some data sources. These data source are candidates for abstractions. For example, a data source that represents a disk file can be an abstraction that handles a disk file format. You will start to have dataflows between instances of data sources, be they UI elements or other source/destinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between your data end points, data may need to be transformed, aggregated, filtered, sorted, validated or transacted (transacted means either all of it or none of it). All of these are great candidates for domain abstractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes a data source or destination will involve a protocol. A protocol is a domain abstraction. One abstraction should be invented to know about the protocol so that no other abstraction needs to know anything about the protocol. Sometimes there are protocols on top of protocols. For example, on top of a serial data stream protocol such as line terminated text, you may have another protocol that specifies the expected content of the first line.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This same idea applies to file formats. A file format, such as a CSV file becomes an abstraction. If there is further formatting expected on top of the basic CSV format, such as a header row, that becomes a second abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with all abstractions, these abstractions know all about the details of something, e.g. a protocol or a format, and become the only thing in the entire application that does know about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result these types of abstractions will usually handle the data going in both directions - sending and receiving, reading and writing.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have hardware devices, each will become an abstraction. For example, an ADC device will become a domain abstraction. The abstraction will know all the detail about the device (everything that is in the datasheet for the device). No other part of the program will know these details.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have an ADC device that has an SPI interface, that will become two abstractions, one that knows all the details of the device, and one that knows all the details of the basic SPI interface.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes a section of requirements will seem like it should become a 'module' or 'function' - for example to parse a string. Try to turn the module or function into something more generally useful. Even if you still end up having only one instance of it for now, by separating that module or function into a general part and a configuration part (that has the information for it&#8217;s specific use in the one part of your application), you will make the general part easier to know what it does - simply because it is more abstract. In time you will often generalise it further and start to have instances of it elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all else fails, just start writing code that implements the requirements in the old fashioned way, not worrying about how messy it gets. When it is functioning as you want, then refactor it to ALA as follows. This is actually quite a straightforward process.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any code that has details that come from requirements, move that to the application layer, leaving behind generalised functions or classes that have parameters or configuration properties that the application will pass in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first the generalised classes may have only one instance each. Look for ones that have similar functionality and combine them. The difference between them become further configuration properties, sometimes in the form of lambda expressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now refactor the generalised classes or functions so that they do not call each other directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the case of functions, this step will involve adding new 'wiring' parameters that themselves take functions. The application will pass in the function that it needs to be wired to. These wiring parameters will usually either be to pull the input or push the output. The wiring function signatures should be even more generalised to allow Lego-like composition of functions by the application. They become interfaces in the programming paradigms layer. Section 1.11 has a worked example of refactoring of functions to ALA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of classes, this step will involve adding dependency injection setters. These will be used by the application to specify what class and instance it will talk to. This step removes all uses of the "new" keyword from the class (except ones that are instantiating classes in a lower abstraction layer such as your framework).</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have any uses of the observer pattern (publish/subscribe pattern), move the code that does the actual registering or subscribing up to the application. Provide a dependency injection setter for it to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dependency injection setters should all take generalised interfaces as thier parameter to allow Lego-like composition of class instances by the application.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your classes and functions are now proper abstractions because they don&#8217;t know anything about the outside world, including who they are wired to, making them reusable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="true2nd-sprint"><a class="anchor" href="#true2nd-sprint"></a>5.1.3. 2nd Sprint</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the second sprint we start converging on normal Agile. You pick one feature to implement first. Agile would say it should be the most essential feature to the MVP (minimum viable product), but this can be tempered by the need to choose one that requires a fewer number of abstractions to be implemented. Next, you design the interfaces that will allow those abstractions to plug together according to the wiring you already have from the first sprint. What messages will these paradigm interfaces need to pass at runtime between the unknown clients to make them work?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may take several sprints to produce the first working feature, depending on the number of abstractions it uses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first this sounds as if it might be just the waterfall method reincarnated. Do an overall design, document it or model it, and then write lots of code before everything suddenly starts working. But the design we created in iteration zero is very different from what a normal waterfall would produce, and is resilient to the sorts of problems waterfall creates. Instead of a ‘high level’ design of how the implementation will work which is lacking in detail, the design is a representation of requirements, in full detail. The design is not a model. It is executable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one more important thing that the design phase in Iteration Zero does. While it deliberately doesn’t address any implementation, it does turn the remainder of the implementation into abstractions, and those abstractions are zero coupled. To convert from executable to actually executing, it only remains to implement these now completely separate parts. You can give these abstractions to any developer to write.  Together the developers will also easily be able to figure out the paradigm interface methods needed to make them work, and the execution models to take care of the execution flow through them with adequate performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often when a project is split into two phases, the first phase turns out to be waste. The devil is in the details so to speak. This happens because the implementation details in phase two are coupled back to and affect the design in phase one. As learnings take place during implementation, the design must change. In ALA the output from phase one is primarily abstractions, which are inherently stable and therefore hide details that can&#8217;t affect the overall design. If the abstractions are good, phase two will typically have little effect on the work done in phase one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the first feature is working, several abstractions will have been implemented. The second feature will take less time because some of the abstractions are already done. In ALA velocity increases as time goes on and keeps increasing until new features only involve instantiating, configuring and wiring domain abstractions in new ways. This velocity acceleration is the complete opposite of what happens in monolithic code.</p>

<h4 id="truelater-sprints"><a class="anchor" href="#truelater-sprints"></a>5.1.4. Later sprints</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine going into a sprint planning meeting with a Product Owner, a small team of developers, and a mature ALA domain that already has all the common domain abstractions done. As the Product Owner explains the requirements, one of the team members writes them down directly as they would be represented in terms of the domain abstractions. Another team member watches and remembers any lost details without slowing the product owner down. A third member implements the acceptance tests in similar fashion, and a fourth provides him with test data. It would be nice to have a tool that compiles the diagram into the equivalent wiring code. With such a tool, the team could have it executing by the end of the meeting. At the end of the planning meeting the development team say to the product owner "Is this what you had in mind?". The team can get immediate feedback from the Product Owner that the requirements have been interpreted correctly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, the planning meeting itself would only produce 'normal' functionality. Usually it is up to the development team, not the Product Owner, to uncover all the abnormal scenarios that can happen, and that is usually where most of the work in a software system goes. Having said that, in a mature domain, the validation of data already has decorator abstractions ready to go.</p>

<p>The graph shows the effort per user story against months into a green-field project. The left axis is arbitrary - the shape of the curves is what is important. For a big ball of mud, experience tells us that the effort increases dramatically and can asymptote at around 2 years as our brains can no longer handle the complexity, and the project must be abandoned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The COCOMO model, which is an average of industry experience, has a power relationship with program size, with an exponent of around 1.05 to 1.2. I have used the mid point, 1.1, for this graph. The model appears to imply that getting lower than 1.0 is a barrier, but there is no reason to believe this is the case. Reuse can make the power become less than 1. The range of 1.05 and 1.2 probably results from some reuse mitigating some ever increasing complexity.</p>
</div>

<p>ALA takes advantage of the fact that zero-coupled abstractions can keep complexity relatively constant and drastically increase reuse. A spectacular fall in effort per user story is thus possible.</p>

<h3 id="truetechnical-debt"><a class="anchor" href="#truetechnical-debt"></a>5.2. Technical debt</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technical debt is real. Convincing your non-technical manager that it is real is not realistic, especially when you tell him that this is based on estimates. He already knows about your 'estimates'. Even if you could measure it, and offer your manager a payback period for a one-day investment in refactoring, there is a problem. He is measured on this sprints performance. Or he is measured on some other criteria such as this years budgeted sales. Technical debt is tomorrow&#8217;s problem, and that is not his problem, not ever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A better answer would be to not generate technical debt in the first place. In Agile we are taught that the architecture depends on the what we learn as we write the code. The Definition of Done is supposed to tell us to clean it up as we learn. But it is also possible that we will learn something that requires previous sprint&#8217;s of work to be cleaned up. A refactoring could need changes to the structure at the largest granularity level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So here is a better solution. What if, as far as possible, we know a meta architecture that all software programs should follow. It is a big scale meta-architecture, so it gets things into the right places in the big scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So now you just get it right in the first place. Isn&#8217;t that better?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now some will argue that they do that already. Their large scale structure is layering, or it is MVC or it something else. I have been told that this doesn&#8217;t work because we fail to actually keep to the prescribed architecture. But think it is because up till now, these architectural patterns have not worked very well.</p>

<p>When the application create an instance of an abstraction, most of the configuration of that abstraction should have defaults.

Any configuration that we wish to enforce goes into the constructor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a counter argument that says that all configuration should be explicit so that nothing can be forgotten.

However, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to have brief reminders of what they are pop up when the mouse is hovered over them.

<p>ALA requires two roles. Both can be done by the same person, but always he should be wearing only one hat at a time. There is the role of the architect, and the role of the developer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The role of the architect is harder than that of the developer, that&#8217;s why we have the role. Expect it to be hard.
Perhaps, surprisingly, the architect&#8217;s main job is to focus on the requirements, and the developers main job is to implement the abstractions (which know nothing of the requirements). In describing the requirements, the architect invents domain abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The architect also has a role in helping the developer to design the interface&#8217;s methods. In other words, how at runtime the system will be made to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This aspect of ALA can also be difficult at times. I have sometimes got stuck for a day or so trying to figure out how the interfaces should work, while still keeping them more abstract than the domain abstractions. The ALA constraints are that these interfaces should work between any two domain abstractions for which it may be meaningful if they are composed together in an application. However, the problem has always been solvable, and once solved, it always seems to have a certain elegance, as if you have created a myriad of possibilities at once. Implementation of the interfaces by the relevant domain abstractions becomes easy. Development then proceeds surprisingly quickly.</p>

<p>Unlike our previous example projects, this project is a real device and had previously been implemented without any knowledge of ALA. So this example serves to make comparisons between ALA and conventional software development. The original software was around 200 KLOC and took 3 people 4 years to write.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The actual device is used by farmers all over the world. It can weigh livestock and keeps a database about them for use in the field. It connects to many other devices and has a large number of features:</p>

<p>The architecture in the original software, was somewhat typically organised into modules and patterns by its developers. Also somewhat typically, it had ended up with a high cost of modifiability - a big ball of mud. After the first release, the first incremental requirement was a 'Treatments' feature, which involved several new tables, new columns in existing tables, new data pages, new settings pages and some new business logic. This feature took a further 3 months to complete (actually 6 calendar months), which seemed out of proportion for the size of the feature. Somehow the Product Owner and managers seemed to have a sort of intuition that if similar things had been done before, such as menus or database tables, those things were already done, and the only new work was in the specific details of the new requirements. Those requirements could be communicated in a relatively short time, say of the order of one hour or one day if you include follow up discussions of abnormal scenarios.  So 6 months did not go down well. ALA, of course, works in exactly this intuitive way that managers hope for. All the things already done are sitting there in the domain abstractions, waiting to be reused, configured and composed into new requirements.</p>

<h4 id="trueiteration-zero-2"><a class="anchor" href="#trueiteration-zero-2"></a>5.7.1. Iteration zero</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the development, there had a been a high number of changes required to the UI. It occurred to me at the time that the underlying elements of the UI were not changing. It was mainly the details of layout and navigation around the device&#8217;s many pages that were changing. The same could be said about the data and business logic. Only details were changing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I took to representing the new designs using box and line drawings representing both the UI layouts and the navigation flows. I realized these diagrams were potentially executable, and wondered how far I could go representing the data and business logic in the same way. I decided to try to represent all of the functionality of the indicator in just one  diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took two weeks to complete the diagram. I used Xmind because it laid itself out. I found that any drawing package that needed you to stop and do housekeeping such as rearranging the layout got in the way so much that you would lose your flow. Xmind allowed me to just enter in the nodes and it would automatically wire them in as either peers or chains and lay them out. The one disadvantage was that Xmind only does trees, so any cross tree relations had to be done manually, but this was also very quick in Xmind once you were used to it. I just let the cross wiring form arcs across parts of the tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Progress was extremely rapid once you had the abstractions and paradigms you needed. And many of them were obvious: softkeys, pages, grids, menus, actions, navigate-action, tables. etc. The programming paradigms would pop into play as needed. After the obvious UI-layout and navigation-flow ones came data-flow and data-flow of table types, events, and schema. The user of this device could set up custom fields, so the schema itself partially came from another  table. At times I would get stuck not knowing how to proceed. The longest of these blocks was half a day. But every time the required abstractions or programming paradigms would firm up, and in the end anything seemed possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diagram itself took shape on the right hand side of the Xmind tree. On the left side I had the invented domain abstractions and paradigm interfaces, with notes to explain them. The right side was mostly just a set of relatively independent features, but there was the odd coupling between them such as UI-navigation lines that were also present in the requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diagram contained around 2000 nodes (instances of the abstractions), which is about 1% of the size of the total original code. There were about 50 abstractions, and several paradigm interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of the diagram is shown below (laid out more nicely in Visio)</p>

<div class="title">Figure 43. Application diagram for the All Animals View feature</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I did the diagram, I deliberately left out anything to do with the aforementioned Treatments feature, so that I could see how easy it might have been to implement once the domain abstractions for the rest of the requirements had matured. So after the diagram was completed, I added the Treatments feature. This involved adding tables, columns to existing tables, a settings screen, a data screen, and some behaviours.  No further abstractions needed to be invented. The incremental time for the diagram additions was of the order of one hour. Obviously testing would be needed on top of that, and the 'Table' abstraction would need additional work so it could migrate itself, a function it had not needed up until this point. Although somewhat theoretical, the evidence was that we could get at least an order of magnitude improvement in incremental maintenance effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At first the diagram seemed too good to be true. It had an elegance all of its own. It apparently captured all of the requirements, without any implementation at all, and yet seemed potentially executable. And if it worked, application modifications of all the kinds we had been doing were going to be almost trivial.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The student&#8217;s job was to write 12 abstractions out of the 50. These 12 were the ones used by that feature. The initial brief was to make the new code work alongside the old code (as would be needed for an incremental legacy rewrite), but the old code was consuming too much time to integrate with, so this part was abandoned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The learning curve for the student was done as daily code inspections, explaining to him where it violated the ALA constraints, and asking him to rework that code for the next day. It was his job to invent the methods he needed in the paradigm interfaces to make the system work, but at the same time keep them abstract by not writing methods or protocols for particular class pairs to communicate. It took about one month for him to fully 'get' ALA and no longer need the inspections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The student completed the 12 classes and got the feature working in the device. The feature included showing data from one database table in a grid, sorting, searching, softkeys, and a menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interestingly, as the student completed certain abstractions that allowed parts of other features to be done, he would quickly go and write the wiring code and have the other features working as well. For example, after the softkeys, actions, navigate, and page abstractions were done, he went through and added all the softkey navigations in the entire product as this only took minutes to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We wanted more funding to retain the student until we had enough to do the treatments feature, and indeed all 50 abstractions with the hope of making this implementation the production code and improving our ongoing maintenance effort. But that was not to be, despite the promising result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have about a quarter of a data point. Some of the abstractions done were among the most difficult, for example the Table abstraction, which had to use SQL and a real database to actually work. So it is not unreasonable to use extrapolation to estimate that the total time to do all 50 abstractions would be about one person-year. That compares with the original 12 person-years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It seems that classes that are abstractions are faster to write. This seems intuitive because you don&#8217;t have any coupling to worry about. More importantly, the two phase design-then-code methodology of ALA allows the developer not to have to deal with large scale structure at the same time as writing code. This frees the developer to go ahead and write the code for the local problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I believe it is beneficial for each developer to be trained to be both an architect and a developer, but just don&#8217;t ask them to do both at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This practical result combined with the theory outlined earlier in this article suggests there ought to be a large improvement in incremental maintenance effort over a big-ball-of-mud architecture.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software design involves our intelligence or brain power. Understandability, readability, complexity are all things very closely related to the brain. Yet in the field of software engineering we pay little attention to how the brain understands our complicated world in order to understand how we should do our software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our brains do it primarily through one mechanism which we have come to call 'abstraction'. We learn abstractions from the commonality of multiple examples, and we then use abstractions without those examples cluttering up the common notion that was learned.</p>

<p>Our ancestors could use a word like 'bring your spear' and it had a simple meaning to them only because all the detail and knowledge that went into building a spear was replaced with the abstraction 'spear'. Without the abstraction, the sentence would have had to be more like "bring the object that we made by joining the object we made by applying blows to the hard material we found at the place&#8230;&#8203;, with the long material we cut in the place with the tall&#8230;&#8203;, by tying it with the long grass material using the gooey stuff we found at the&#8230;&#8203;". Even this sentence was only made possible by other abstractions: joining, material, blows, hard, long (twice), cut, tall, tying, gooey, and found. If we expanded all of them until we were only using a few basic concepts like 'object' and 'place', we would have a sentence so long that we could never communicate at all. That&#8217;s what abstractions do, and how our brains make use of them. The word spear, in turn can be used to create a new abstraction, a hunting plan, while all of that other detail remains hidden from that new context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with software engineering is we are not making use of this way that the brain works. Simply put, we are not creating good abstractions. This lets the complexity inside one 'module' spill out into other modules. Abstractions, not modules, are the only mechanism that allows us to hide details at design-time.</p>

<p>As software engineers we do learn and use many abstractions. For example if we want to protect simultaneous access to the resource, our brain should conjure up 'mutex'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the brain already 'knows about' an abstraction, the abstraction is like any other single line of code, such as a mutex. We can make use of a mutex without having to deal with the details and complexities of how it works. We don&#8217;t have to think about the fact that we may have to wait for the resource. Nor that another thread may start running if we have to wait. Nor that if a higher priority thread preempts us while we have the resource, we may have it for a long time. Nor that if a still higher priority thread needs it during that long time, we will be given temporary priority to finish our use of it. We can just simply use the abstraction for protecting a resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstractions like mutex, regex, SQL are already invented by the 'culture' of software engineering, much like memes in the real world have been passed down to us. Where we fall down is when we get into a particular domain where the abstractions have not yet been invented, and we need to invent them. It is not easy to invent new abstractions, but invent them we must, at a rate far higher than is normal for cultural evolution.</p>

<p>Of the overwhelming list of engineering topics that we listed in Chapter One, this topic that is the most fundamental to ALA, and the one most needed for explaining it.

<p>Abstraction will be the king. The short reason why we start with abstraction is that our quality attributes, complexity and understandability are very much to do with how our brains work, and for 100,000 years at least, our brains have worked with abstractions to understand our world. Abstractions are the only mechanism our brains use for dealing with otherwise complex things.</p>

<p>As in a chess game, winning is only about protecting the king. But this Abstraction king is benevolent. If he is destroyed, you do not lose the game immediately. It will take time, but you will lose.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are other contenders to be king in the engineering topics list. For example, it is said that the best thing about TDD is not the testing but the emergence of better abstractions. TDD is like a lord that serves the king. It usually serves the king, causing you to make better abstractions. But sometimes it just serves its own purpose and makes the abstraction worse. It just produces code that works where it passes and no more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another contender is microservices. It is popular because it improves your abstractions by making them harder to destroy with cross coupling. But it too is just a lord. Because it provides physical boundaries that in normal software would be crossed, it serves the king. But by serving the abstraction king directly we can have logical boundaries, and all their benefits, even in 'monolithic' code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Classes, Modules, functions and encapsulation are artefacts of the language and do their thing at compile-time. They are not necessarily abstractions. They have been around for about 60 years, not enough time for our brains to see them in the same way as the compiler does. Although abstractions are implemented using these artefacts, ALA needs them to also be abstractions. In ALA "abstraction" is the term we use for the artefacts of our design instead of classes, modules, functions, or components, all of which are extremely fragile as abstractions.</p>

<p>A good abstraction separates the knowledge of different worlds. A clock is a good abstraction. On one side is the world of cog wheels. On the other side is someone trying to be on time in their busy daily schedule. Neither knows anything about the details of the other. SQL is another good abstraction. On one side is the world of fast indexing algorithms. On the other is finding all the orders for a particular customer. Let us consider a domain abstraction - the calculation of loan repayments. On one side is the world of mathematics with the derivation and implementation of a formula. On the other, the code is about a person wanting to know if they can afford to buy a house. If your abstractions don&#8217;t separate knowledge of different worlds like this, then you are probably just factoring common code. Find the abstraction in that common code. Make it hide something complicated that&#8217;s really easy to use and really useful, like a clock.</p>

<p>The creativity cycle starts with abstractions, such as cogs and hands, instantiates them, configures them for a particular use, then composes them into a new abstraction.

<h4 id="trueabstractions-need-ports"><a class="anchor" href="#trueabstractions-need-ports"></a>6.2.5. Abstractions need ports</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In traditional programs, inputs (or at least incoming function calls) are typically part of the module or class&#8217;s interface but outputs (or at least outgoing function calls) are typically just buried in the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is fine if calling functions or methods in a lower abstraction layer. However, it is absolutely not fine if calling functions or methods of a peer in the same abstraction layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA all inputs and outputs to or from peers in the same layer must be 'ports'.
There should be one port for each peer that can be wired. This is the Interface Segregation Principle. A port is a logical wirable connection point. A port either implements or accepts an interface. Outgoing function calls buried in the code that at run-time will go to a peer must only go to the port, which has an indirection mechanism of some kind.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programming languages encourage all outgoing function or method calls to refer directly to the destination, or the destination&#8217;s interface, so you have to make an effort to avoid doing this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A port is not an artefact of programming languages (yet) so they must be implemented logically somehow as normal code. To code a logical port, you need to do two things.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The interface type of the port must not be owned by another peer abstraction. The interface type must be from a lower abstraction layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the port is the name of the field that accepts the interface.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A port can have multiple interfaces. In this case I make the names of the multiple fields contain the port name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using an asynchronous event driven design, the equivalent of a conventional outgoing function call is typically written something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Send(Event, Receiver, Priority);</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where the Event is something the receiver defines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, we are sending the event directly to a peer abstraction using the peer abstraction&#8217;s interface (its event).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, sending an event should be self-oriented, so written something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Send(Sender, SenderPort)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sender just sends the event out, not knowing where it goes, and the port identifies the event (or you could have both port and event). This just tells the event framework who the sender and sender&#8217;s port was. The event framework gets information from the application in the top layer to know what to do with the event. The application has the specific knowledge to know what an event from a given sender on a given port means, and therefore where it should go, and what the priority should be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, classes, modules, components, functions should all have ports for both input and output. They should not own the interface types for these ports, whether they are incoming or outgoing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An output port from an abstraction may say 'This has happened' or 'Here is my result', not 'do this next', or 'here is your input'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are multiple ways to implement the indirection inherent in ports for outgoing calls. They can be callbacks, signals &amp; slots, dependency injection, or calls to a framework send function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that inputs and outputs are not necessarily on different ports. We may want to wire both inputs and outputs between two instances or two abstractions with a single wiring operation. The general case is that a single wiring operation wires multiple interfaces that are logically one port. One contains methods going in one direction and the other contains methods going in the other.</p>

<p>"It has been suggested that there is some kind of law of nature telling us that the amount of intellectual effort needed grows with the square of program length. But, thank goodness, no one has been able to prove this law. And this is because it need not be true. We all know that the only mental tool by means of which a very finite piece of reasoning can cover a myriad cases is called “abstraction”; as a result the effective exploitation of his powers of abstraction must be regarded as one of the most vital activities of a competent programmer. In this connection it might be worth-while to point out that the purpose of abstracting is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise. Of course I have tried to find a fundamental cause that would prevent our abstraction mechanisms from being sufficiently effective. But no matter how hard I tried, I did not find such a cause. As a result I tend to the assumption —up till now not disproved by experience— that by suitable application of our powers of abstraction, the intellectual effort needed to conceive or to understand a program need not grow more than proportional to program length."</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "conceive" part I agree with, if by that we mean the development. However, the "intellectual effort to understand" part needs further insight. We shouldn&#8217;t have to read an entire program to understand a part of it. We ought to be able to understand any one part of it in isolation. The effort to read any one part should be approximately constant. In Chapter One of this article there was a quality graph of complexity <a href="#ComplexityGraph1">here</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, the design-time view of the system is nothing more than a static view of instances of abstractions composed together. In a typical application, there will be of the order of fifty different domain abstractions - not a difficult number to familiarize yourself with in a new domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstractions have no relationship with one another. Each is a standalone entity like a standalone program. If every abstraction contains say 500 lines of code, and the system itself contains 500 lines (instances of abstractions wired together) then the most complex the software gets is that of 500 lines of code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if one abstraction is overly complex internally, say it conceals a piece of legacy code using a facade pattern, that doesn&#8217;t affect the complexity of any other part of the system.</p>

<p>A software program can be temporally confusing. Everything that happens at design-time is in preparation for what will happen at run-time. Our low-level imperative languages tend to keep the two congruent. The statements in the program at design-time follow in the same order as they will execute at run-time. The only difference between the two is a time shift and the speeding up of the clock.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we want the knowledge of run-time dependencies to be moved inside another abstraction, this congruence between design-time and run-time must be broken. Unfortunately, developers start out by learning a low-level imperative language, so it becomes unnatural to them to architect their programs without this congruence.

<h3 id="truewiring-pattern-part-one"><a class="anchor" href="#truewiring-pattern-part-one"></a>6.5. Wiring pattern - Part one</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now introduce the pattern that both solves the congruence problem just discussed in the previous section, and provides the alternative to all those disallowed coupling types discussed earlier. This pattern is usually an important part of ALA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: The wiring pattern is not necessarily a part of an ALA architecture. For example, if your whole problem is just an algorithm, and therefore suits a functional programming style, then you can still compose abstractions with function abstractions, provided all function calls are knowledge dependencies, and not say, just passing data or events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using monads, especially I/O monads, or RX (reactive extensions), especially with hot observables, you are already using the wiring pattern. The pipes and filter pattern is also an example of the wiring pattern. Labview or Node-Red can use the wiring pattern. There are many other examples of the wiring pattern. Most support a data-flow programming paradigm. Here we generalise the pattern to support any programming paradigm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The wiring pattern may be the same as the "Component Pattern" in some literature if used with what is referred to as 'configurable modularity' or 'abstracted interactions'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The wiring pattern allows lines on your application diagram to mean any programming paradigm you want that express your requirements. It also allows you to implement multiple programming paradigms together in the same diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using dependency injection with explicit code for the wiring (not auto-wiring), then you are half way there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The wiring pattern separates design-time/run-time congruence. It works by having a 'wiring-time' that is separated from run-time. 'Wiring-time' can happen any time before run-time. It can happen immediately before it, as for instance in LINQ statements or RX with a cold observable. It becomes powerful when we make wiring-time congruent with design-time. Usually the wiring code will actually run at initialization time, when the program first starts running. That initialization code becomes the architectural design.</p>

<p>At run-time we know that A will talk to B. So we design A to have an association with B. The association may first appear on a UML model, or it may go straight into the code something like this:</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>static component A
{

<p>Note that although dependency injection was used, it only eliminated part of the dependency, that of which particular subtype of B it is going to talk to, but A still knows the general type B, which is not allowed in ALA. (Part of the problem here is that A and B were probably arrived at by decomposition, and so they have subtle knowledge of each other, for example of how they collaborate.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If A and B are collaborating, they are not abstractions. Their knowledge of each other at design-time (to enable their relationship at run-time) binds them to each other so that neither can be reused in any other way. And if they can&#8217;t be reused, they can&#8217;t be abstract.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s revisit the water molecule analogy we discussed earlier for the Whole-Part pattern, and develop it further to be clearer how these dependencies affect abstractions. Let&#8217;s say we have decomposed water into two components, Oxygen and Hydrogen. Oxygen will talk to Hydrogen to get an electron, so we write:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>component Oxygen
{

<p>In the real world, oxygen is a very useful abstraction for making other molecules. In writing code this way to make water, we have tied it to hydrogen. Oxygen can&#8217;t be used anywhere else, at least not without bringing with it two hydrogens, rendering it useless. By implementing the Oxygen-Hydrogen relationship needed to make water in oxygen, we have destroyed the oxygen abstraction. We never even made the water abstraction. To understand water, we would have to read the code inside oxygen, where the parts about water have become entangled with the inner workings of oxygen, protons and neutrons and all that stuff. Oxygen is also used to make caffeine. We could never make coffee!</p>

<p>Abstractions are fragile and get destroyed easily, so we have to take care to protect them. What we needed to do was to put the knowledge about the relationship between oxygen and hydrogen to make water in a new abstraction called Water.</p>

<p>In general, to break coupling between peer modules A and B, we move the knowledge of the coupling to a higher level abstraction (less abstract level) where it belongs. Let&#8217;s call it C. C is a more specific abstraction. The knowledge is encapsulated there - it never appears as a dependency of any kind. And it is cohesive with other knowledge that may be contained inside abstraction C.</p>

<p>The diagram above is only to show the ALA knowledge dependency relationships between the three abstractions. It doesn&#8217;t yet show explicitly that an instance of Abstraction A will be wired to an instance of Abstraction B. In practice we never actually draw knowledge dependencies. We are just doing so here to show how ALA works. We would draw it in this way instead:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we have the explicit wiring. It looks a lot like the original diagram where we had no C. But where the knowledge is coded is very different. Because it is C and not A that has the knowledge of the relationship between A and B, Abstractions A and B do not change. They continue to know nothing of the connection. They remain abstractions. They remain re-usable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may seem at first that adding the extra entity C is a cost, but in fact C is an asset. It shows the structure of the system. It shows it explicitly. It shows it in one small understandable place. And it is executable - it is not a model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original abstractions were left below C to show that they still exist as free abstractions to be used elsewhere. They are not contained by C in any way as modules from a decomposition process would be. The A and B inside C are only instances. We wouldn&#8217;t normally bother to draw the abstractions below. So we just draw this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/diagram-14.png" alt="diagram 14.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>C must achieve the connection between A and B either at compile-time or run-time. With current languages, the easiest time to do this is at initialization time, when the program first starts running. This is similar to dependency injection, except that we are not going to inject the instance of B into A.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is what the code inside C might look like:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Abstraction C
{
   var a = new A();
   var b = new B();
   a.wireTo(b);
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically we will write the code using the fluent pattern, with the wireTo method always returning the object on which it is called, or the wireIn method always returning the object wired to. The constructor already returns the created object by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Abstraction C
{
   new A().wireTo(new B());

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are half-way through explaining the wiring pattern. Now we turn our attention to how A and B can communicate without knowing anything about each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This part of the pattern is also called "Abstract Interactions"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, one way is that C acts as the intermediary. This way is less preferred because it adds to C&#8217;s responsibilities. But it is sometimes necessary if there are some abstractions brought in from outside. Such abstractions will 'own' their own interfaces or may come with a contract which C will have to know about. C will usually have to wire in an adapter, or handle the communications between the two abstractions itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A better way, because it leads to an architectural property of composability, is that A and B know about a 4th abstraction that is more abstract than either of them. This is legal because it is a design-time knowledge dependency.  Let&#8217;s call it I.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/diagram-15.png" alt="diagram 15.png">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I is an interface of some kind. It may or may not be an actual artefact. What it must be is knowledge that is more abstract than A and B and therefore knows nothing of A and B. It is more ubiquitous and more reusable than A and B are. In other words we can&#8217;t just design I to meet the particular communication needs of A and B. That would cause A and B to have some form of coupling or collaboration with each other, and again destroy them as abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I is so abstract, ubiquitous and reusable, that it corresponds to the concept of a programming paradigm. We will cover programming paradigm abstractions in following sections because they are a critically important part of ALA. We will see that ALA is polyglot with respect to programming paradigms.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Returning to a software example, let&#8217;s choose a single simple programming paradigm: activity flow. This programming paradigm is the same as the UML Activity diagram. When we wire A to B and they use this paradigm, it means that B starts after A finishes. If A and B accept and provide this interface respectively, then wiring them together by drawing an arrow will have that meaning, and cause that to happen at run-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/diagram-16.png" alt="diagram 16.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is easy to create an interface for the activity-flow programming paradigm. It has a single method, let&#8217;s call it 'start'. Many abstractions at the level of A and B can either provide or accept this paradigm interface. Then instances of them can be wired up in any order and they will follow in sequence just like an Activity diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the Activity Diagram is not necessarily imperative in that any Activity can take an amount of time to complete that is not congruent with the actual CPU execution of code. In other words activities can be asynchronous with the underlying code execution, and for example, delay themselves during their execution, or wait for something else to finish, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code in Abstraction A could look something like this. Don&#8217;t take too much notice of the exact method used to accomplish the wiring. There are many ways to do this using only knowledge dependencies. The important thing is that A continues to know nothing about its peers, continues to be an abstraction, and yet can be wired with its peers to take part in any specific activity flow sequence:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre> Abstraction A : IActivity
 {
    private IActivity next = null;

    public IActivity wireTo(IActivity _next)
    {
        next = _next;
        return _next;
    }

    IActivty.start()
    {
        // start work
    }

    // code that runs when work is finished.
    // may be called from the end of start, or any time later
    private finishedWork()
    {
        if (next!=null) next.start();
    }
 }</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstraction A both <em>provides</em> and <em>accepts</em> the interface. This allows it to be wired before or after any of its peer abstractions. In ALA we use the word 'accepts' rather than 'requires' because there is often an end to a chain of abstraction instances wired together. If no next interface is wired in, the activity flow ends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstraction B would be written in the same way, as it also knows about the Activity flow interface:</p>

As an aside, in C# projects, we wrote wireTo as an extension method for all objects.

The ideal would be a language where we don&#8217;t have to decide if the data-flow will be push or pull, synchronous or asynchronous, buffered or unbuffered or other characteristics of communications.

<p>This is a similar concept to a DSL (but not quite the same). If the abstraction level were more specific, we wouldn&#8217;t have the versatility to describe changing requirements or new applications in the domain (too expressive). If it were were more general, we would have to write more code to describe the requirements (not expressive enough).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I noticed during 40 years of code bases written at our company, two did not deteriorate under maintenance. They always remained as easy to maintain as they were in the beginning, if not easier. All others deteriorated badly. Some deteriorated so badly that they could no longer be maintained at all. At the time we din&#8217;t know why and could not predict which way it would go. It seemed as if you just got lucky or unlucky.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps it was the type of changes that came along? But the two code bases that were easy to maintain seemed to be easy for any kinds of change. And the ones that were hard were hard for any change. This continued to hold for years on end. Of course, most changes were changes to requirements, but often enough, changes would be for performance or other reasons. These also seemed easy in these two code bases, but hard everywhere else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I began to look at the structure and style of the easy and hard code. The easy code was not complicated while the hard code had degenerated well into the complex. The two easy code bases were doing very different things in very different ways, so there was apparently not a common structure or style. But they did have one thing in common. The code that represented the knowledge of the requirements was separated out. That code <em>only</em> described requirements, and it was expressed in terms of other things that were relatively independent, reusable and easy to understand (what we call abstractions).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is what first gave rise to one of the core tenets in ALA. The first separation is not along the lines of functional or physical parts of the system, such as UI, Business logic, and Data model. The first separation is code that just describes requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course this has a strong parallel with how DSLs work. Is ALA just DSLs? There are several differences. Firstly in ALA we don&#8217;t try to create a sandbox language for a domain expert to maintain applications. We don&#8217;t go as far as an external DSL. It&#8217;s for the developer and we don&#8217;t want to cut him off from the power he already has when it is needed. We just give him a way to organise the code and a process to get him there - describe the requirements knowledge in terms of abstractions and then trust that those abstractions, when written, will make it work.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two modules will have collaborative knowledge. We reason that the sender must know the meaning to formulate the message, and the receiver must know the meaning to interpret the message. So how can it be avoided? The answer is to make the sender and receiver in same abstraction. They both know the same knowledge, so they are cohesive, so they should be together. In the logical view of the system, they are two instances of the one abstraction. We let the physical view fact that the sender and receiver will be deployed in different places drive them to be different modules.</p>

<p>Requirements are usually understated initially in terms of abnormal conditions. However, they are usually communicated quite quickly relative to the time to write the code. In ALA, they are separately represented. The precise expression of the requirements using the right programming paradigms should take about the same amount of information as the English explanation of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, ALA probably requires about the same amount of total code. But once the requirements are represented, the domain abstractions are known and they are independent small programs with dependencies only on the programming paradigm interfaces used. This independence should make them much easier to write. As the system matures, the effort to modify gets less as more domain abstractions come on line as tested, mature and useful building blocks. The final cost of maintenance should be much less than an equivalent ball of mud architecture.</p>

<p>It is generally accepted that a software architecture must, by necessity, leave out some details. Somehow we need to find a satisfactory architecture without considering all the details. Often models are used to represent the architecture. Like its metaphor in the real world, a model leaves out details. The problem is they can leave out arbitrary details.

<p>ALA therefore does not use the model metaphor. Instead, it uses diagrams (if not plain old text). Of course, this distinction comes down to semantics. I define a diagram as different from a model in that it does not leave out details arbitrarily. The only way to leave out details in an ALA diagram is inside the boxes, in other words inside abstractions. Because abstractions already have the required meaning when used in the diagram, the details omitted can&#8217;t be important to the diagram, and can&#8217;t affect the architectural design.</p>

<p>The distinction between diagrams and models explained in the previous section gives rise to an interesting property of the ALA architecture. Diagrams are executable. Therefore the architecture itself will be executable. When the implementation of the abstractions is complete, there will be no work left to do to make the architecture execute (apart from practical considerations of bugs, misinterpretations of the requirements, performance issues, improvements to the initially conceived set of domain abstractions, and the like).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There should be two aspects of an architecture, the meta-architecture and the specific architecture. If using ALA, ALA itself is the meta-architecture and the top level application diagram is the specific architecture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your specific architecture is executable, it is also code. There is no separate documentation or model trying to act as a second source of truth.</p>

<p>The final architecture of your software will consist only of abstractions. These abstractions will need to be independently readable and understandable. To meet this need, all of the abstractions will be small, even the 'system level' ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conversely, none should be too small. We want them small enough to allow the human brain to understand them, but there is no need for them to be smaller, or we will just end up with an inordinate number of them. This inordinate number will tax the brain in a different way, by causing it to have to learn more abstractions than necessary in a given domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ideal abstraction size is probably in the range of 50 to 500 lines of code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The common terms, modules, components, or layers often result from a decomposition process and therefore are parts of a specific system. The system may have only one of each type. The parts have a lower abstraction level than the system because they are just specific parts of it. In ALA we want to reverse this so that parts are more abstract than the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But say you do end up with some single use abstractions and implement it in a static way, it is important to still see these entities as two aspects in one: an abstraction and an instance.</p>

<h4 id="truelayers-pattern"><a class="anchor" href="#truelayers-pattern"></a>6.11.1. Layers pattern</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With only design-time knowledge dependencies to deal with, layers are used for organising these dependencies so that there are no circular dependencies, and that they all go toward more abstract, more stable abstractions. As the name "Abstraction Layered Architecture" suggests, layers are crucially important to ALA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the section on the wiring pattern we ended with three layers:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/diagram-21.png" alt="diagram 21.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a Layers pattern that also controls dependencies, but since most systems have numerous run-time dependencies between elements represented as design-time dependencies, these layers are used for the run-time dependencies. It is usually explained that each layer is built on services provided by the layer below it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One example is the UI/Business Logic/Data model. Another example is the OSI communications model, where the layers are Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data link, and Physical. In ALA, each of these ends up being turned 90 degrees. Metaphorically they become chains. In ALA each component wouldn&#8217;t know about the components next to it. That applies symmetrically, to the left and to the right. Data goes in both directions. At run-time, everything must exist for the system to work. It doesn&#8217;t really make sense to use a asymmetrical layers metaphor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The design pattern for layers does have one or two examples of layering used by knowledge dependencies. The term ‘layer’ is therefore an overloaded term in software engineering. When used for knowledge dependencies, the English term 'layer' is a better metaphor. If a lower layer of a wall were to be removed, the layers above would literally collapse, and that&#8217;s exactly what would happen in knowledge dependency layering. The layers above literally need the knowledge of abstractions in lower layers to make any sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA&#8217;s ripple effects are already under control because the only dependencies are on abstractions, which are inherently stable, and furthermore, those abstraction must be more abstract. However, to make these dependencies even less likely to cause an issue during maintenance, we try to make the abstraction layers discrete, and separated by approximately an order of magnitude. In other words each layer is approximately an order of magnitude more abstract than the one above it. More abstract means more ubiquitous, so the layers contain abstractions which have greater scope, and greater potential reuse as you go down the layers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We won&#8217;t need many layers. If you think about abstraction layers in the real world, we can get from atoms to the human brain in four layers. Remember the creativity cycle early in this article. We only need to go around the cycle four times to make a brain: Atoms, Molecules such as proteins, Cells such as neurons, neural nets, and finally the brain itself.</p>

<p>We start with four layers. They have increasing scope as you go down. This type of layering was described by Meiler Page-Jones. Meiler Page-Jones’ names for the four layers are: "Application domain", "Business domain", "Architecture domain", and "Foundation domain".</p>

<h5 id="trueapplication-layer-2"><a class="anchor" href="#trueapplication-layer-2"></a>Application layer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The top layer has knowledge specific to the application, and nothing but knowledge specific to the application, i.e. representing your requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple Application might wire a grid directly to a table. When Business logic is needed, any number of decorators (that do validation, constraints, calculations, filtering, sorting, etc.) can be inserted in between the grid and the table by changing the wiring of the application.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="truedomain-abstractions-layer-2"><a class="anchor" href="#truedomain-abstractions-layer-2"></a>Domain abstractions layer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Knowledge specific to the domain goes in this layer. A domain might correspond to a company or a department. As such, teams can collaborate on the set of abstractions to be provided there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications have knowledge dependencies reaching into this layer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="trueprogramming-paradigms-layer-2"><a class="anchor" href="#trueprogramming-paradigms-layer-2"></a>Programming Paradigms layer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All knowledge specific to the types of computing problems you are solving, such as execution models, programming paradigm interfaces and any frameworks to support these, is in this layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Programming Paradigms layer will abstract away how the processor is managed to execute different pieces of code at the right time. Execution models are covered in detail in chapter four.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This layer is also where we arrange for our domain abstractions to have common simple connections instead of having a specific language for each pair of modules that communicate. The Programming Paradigms layer abstracts away ubiquitous communications languages (which we have been referring to as programming paradigms in this article.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s use the clock as a real world example. (This is the same clock example we used in section 2.9 when introducing the role abstractions play in the creative process.) One of the the domain abstractions for clocks is a cog wheel. Cog wheels communicate with one another. But they don&#8217;t do it with communications languages specific to each pair, even though each pair must have the correct diameters and tooth sizes to mesh correctly. The cog abstraction just knows about the common paradigm of meshing teeth, a more abstract language in this lower layer. This language is analogous to a programming paradigm. With it, the clock abstraction (which is in the highest layer) can then instantiate two cogs and configure them to mesh. The concept of cog thus remains an abstraction and instances of it are composable. The clock, which already knows that two instances of cogs are needed, also knows where they will be fitted and what their diameters must be. The knowledge in the clock abstraction is cohesive.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="truelanguage-layer"><a class="anchor" href="#truelanguage-layer"></a>Language layer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The language layer is included to show what is below the other three layers. It is not hardware as you would find in many other layering schemes, nor is it a database, because it is not run-time dependencies we are layering. The lowest layer has the remaining knowledge you need to understand your code, that of the languages, libraries and any very generic APIs you may use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hardware and database do have a place, but we will cover it later. Being a run-time dependency, it will be well off to one side and slightly higher up.</p>

<h5 id="truedomain-abstractions-api"><a class="anchor" href="#truedomain-abstractions-api"></a>Domain Abstractions API</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The boundary between the application layer and the domain abstractions layer is an API that supports the solution space of your requirements (within the constraints of your domain).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The scope of the Domain Abstractions layer defines the expressiveness available to the application. The greater the scope (or bigger the domain), the more applications are able to do. The cost is expressiveness. The applications will have to be longer to specify what is to be done. Conversely, a smaller domain allows less versatility in the applications, but there is greater expressiveness, which means you write less code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="truepossible-extra-layers"><a class="anchor" href="#truepossible-extra-layers"></a>Possible extra layers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The domain is an approximation of all the potential applications and all the modifications you are likely to make. If the domain is large because it is enterprise wide, you could have an additional layer for small domains. The enterprise domain would include enterprise wide abstractions such as a person identity, and the smaller domains would add additional, more specific abstractions, such as a customer (by composition).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the applications are large and themselves need to be composed of features, an additional layer that supports plug-in style abstractions may work well. Plug-in abstractions may actually be instances of domain abstractions, such as a settings Menu, or a customer Table. A feature can then add settings to the menu, or columns to the table that remain unknown to any other features.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="trueprogramming-paradigms-api"><a class="anchor" href="#trueprogramming-paradigms-api"></a>Programming Paradigms API</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The boundary between all higher layers and the Programming Paradigms layer is another API. It separates the domain knowledge from the programming paradigm implementation knowledge. It almost always takes care of the ‘execution flow’, the way the computer CPU itself will be controlled to execute all the various parts of the code and when, often using a framework. On the other hand, the Programming Paradigms layer doesn’t necessarily have any code at all. Remember that the layers are ‘knowledge dependencies’, not run-time dependencies, so the paradigm could be a ‘computational model’ that just provides the knowledge of patterns of how to constracut the code in higher layers. The decisions about use of the patterns and about the way the code is executed have already been made and exist in the Programming Paradigms layer.</p>

<h5 id="truerate-of-change-of-knowledge"><a class="anchor" href="#truerate-of-change-of-knowledge"></a>Rate of change of knowledge</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The knowledge in each of the four layers has different change rates.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Language layer contains knowledge that will likely change only a few times in your career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Programming Paradigms layer knowledge changes when you move to different computing problems types, or discover different approaches to solving a broad range of problems. For example, if you have not yet used an event driven execution model or state machines in your career, and you move into the embedded systems space, you will very likely need to have those skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Domain Abstractions layer has knowledge that changes when you change the company you work for. It will change at the rate that the company&#8217;s domain is changing, or is becoming better understood. If your company uses lean principles, one of the things you want to do is capture knowledge for reuse. This is the whole point of the Domain Abstractions layer, it is a set of artefacts that capture the company&#8217;s reusable knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="trueala-is-a-logical-view"><a class="anchor" href="#trueala-is-a-logical-view"></a>6.12. ALA is a logical view</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the system is deployed on multiple machines (this is the subject of the physical view), the ALA abstractions, layers and diagrams all remain identical. A simple application diagram connecting a temperature sensor to a display field does not change if the sensor happens to be on a Mars Rover and the display field is at JPL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally, the performance view also does not affect the ALA logical view. This is a many faceted problem that we will return to later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA usually works very well with aspects of the development view as discussed elsewhere. For example, the fact that domain abstractions have zero coupling greatly helps the allocation of teams. The teams need only cooperate on a common understanding of the programming paradigms used.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="trueno-separation-of-ui"><a class="anchor" href="#trueno-separation-of-ui"></a>6.13. No separation of UI</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA we don&#8217;t separate the UI unless there is a reason to do so. The amount of knowledge in the UI that comes from a particular application&#8217;s requirements is usually quite small and that knowledge is usually quite cohesive and coupled with the business logic of the feature it belongs with. For example, the layout of the UI is a small amount of information, and the bindings of the UI elements to data are a small amount of information. So all that cohesive knowledge is kept together, encapsulated inside a feature. Instead, the UI is composed from Domain UI abstractions. Being domain specific, these abstractions have a little more knowledge to them than generic widgets. For example, their domain knowledge may include style, functionality and suitability to their domain context. For example, a softkey or menu item will have an appearance, functionality and suitability to the way UIs are designed in the domain. Using one in a specific application only requires a label and a binding to an action. They will also provide consistency in the domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there is an actual requirement to have different UIs, say a command based UI and a GUI based UI, then you just abstract the UI abstractions further until they can be used either way. The UI abstractions still remain an integral part of the application.</p>

<h3 id="truefeatures"><a class="anchor" href="#truefeatures"></a>6.14. Features</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may have noticed throughout this article the word 'features' being used quite often instead of 'Application'. When the application is large, we can think of it as a composition of feature abstractions. This is exactly what happens in natural language in the domain when describing requirements. 'Features' is just the word we give the natural abstractions in the requirements, without even realizing it. Just go with this in the software itself.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Say you are implementing a particularly large domain abstraction such as a 'Table', or are implementing a complicated programming paradigm. We would like to break these up into smaller components. Do we introduce a fractal type of structure to deal with this? Should we have hierarchical layers within layers contained completely inside the Table abstraction?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The astute reader will have noticed the non-ALA thinking in the statement "break these up into smaller components". In ALA we don&#8217;t decompose a large abstraction into components, we compose it from abstractions, which if necessary we invent as we go. These new abstractions will have a scope or level of ubiquity, stability and reuse that corresponds to one of the existing layers. So there should be no hierarchical or fractal structures in ALA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the domain that these new abstractions are in won&#8217;t be the same domain as the one that provides for the writing of Application requirements. For example, the implementation of the Table abstraction will need to be connected to another abstraction in the domain of databases. One of the abstractions in that domain will know about a particular database, say SQL Lite. A polymorphic interface should exist between the two. That interface, being more abstract than either the Table or the SQL Lite abstractions, will be in the next layer down, where both the Table and the MySQL abstractions can have a knowledge dependency on it. Of course the SQL abstraction will actually be further composed of an adapter and a real database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some application domain abstractions are complicated. Examples of these are abstractions requiring a connection to an actual database, actual hardware, the Internet, etc. Implementing these will typically wire out horizontally into other technical domains. You can visualise them going in multiple directions, which is exactly the idea of Alistair Cockburn&#8217;s hexagonal architecture.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we start assembling requirements from abstractions, a topic that we will cover in coming sections, we will be using symbolic indirection, such as function calls or the new keyword with a class name. Unless a symbolic indirection is to an abstraction, they are for the compiler to follow at compile-time, not for the code reader to follow at design-time. Understanding the code relies on allowing the reader to read a small cohesive block of code. The reader should never have to follow the indirection somewhere else. If you don&#8217;t achieve this, and abstraction is the only way you can, then any decoupled architecture will be <em>more</em> difficult to read.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstraction allows indirection while allowing the reader to continue reading on to the next line. The importance of this property cannot be overstated. As soon as we start thinking in mere programming language terms of modules, components, interfaces, classes, or functions, the abstraction will start to be lost. These other artefacts may have benefits at compile-time (the compiler can understand them), but that is not useful at design-time unless they are also good abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It would be nice if your compiler could tell you that you have a missing abstraction, just as it does for a missing semicolon, but alas, they are not capable of understanding abstractions yet. So it is still entirely up to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstraction is almost a black and white type of property. It&#8217;s either there or it isn&#8217;t. If the reader of your code does not have to follow the indirection, you have it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Footnote: When the reader of your code meets your abstraction for the first time (usually a domain abstraction in a domain they have recently come into), ideally their IDE will give them the meaning in a little pop-up paragraph as their mouse hovers over any of its uses. Depending on the quality of the abstraction, after a single exposure, their brain will have the insight, like a light coming on, illuminating a meaning. The brain will form a new neuron to represent the concept. Since the reader will hopefully remain in the domain for some time, this overhead to readability shouldn&#8217;t be large.</p>

<p>The scorecard ASCII template has letter place-holders for the scores. (A single letter is used so it doesn&#8217;t take up much space on the template design.) Different letters are used for different types of scores. Digits are used to specify where multiple scores of the same type are arranged on the scoreboard. They are like indexes. Either 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional indexes can be used in the scoreboard template. For example, the frame scores in ten-pin bowling have scores for each ball for each frame, F00, F01 etc, as shown in the example above.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The scorecard abstraction needs functions it can use to get the actual scores. The functions are configured into little 'binding' objects that we then wire to the scoreboard. The binding objects are configured with the letter that they return the score for.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the diagrams must be turned into text code to actually execute, it is important in ALA to do these architecture design diagrams first. They not only give you the application, they give you the architectural design by giving you the domain abstractions and programming paradigms as well. If you try to design an ALA structure in your head while you write it directly in code, you will get terribly confused and make a mess. Using UML class diagrams will make it even worse. Code at different abstraction levels will end up everywhere, and run-time dependencies will abound. Our programming languages, and the UML Class diagram, are just not designed to support abstraction layered thinking - it is too easy to add bad dependencies (function calls or 'new' keywords) into code in the wrong places.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that at run-time, not all data-flows have to go directly between wired up instances of domain abstractions. The data can come up into the application layer code, and then back down. This was the case when we did the functional composition example in Chapter One. In this application we are doing that with the code in the square boxes that get the score from the engine. The important thing is that all the code in the application is specific to the application requirements.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was listening to a talk by Eric Evans where he said that Microservices works because it provides boundaries that are harder to cross. We have been trying to build logical boundaries for 60 years, he said, and failed. So now we use tools like Docker that force us to use say REST style interfaces in oder to have physical boundaries. I have also heard it suggested that using multiple MCUs in an embedded system is a good thing because it provides physical boundaries for our software components. And I think, really? Is that the only way we can be create a logical boundary? I can tell you that multiple MCUs for this reason is not a good idea if only because all those MCUs will need updating, and the mechanisms and infrastructure needed to do that make it not worth it. Unless there is a good reason, such as to make different parts of your code independently deployable, the extra infrastructure required for physical boundaries that are just logical boundaries is not necessary. Furthermore, physical boundaries, like modules do not necessarily make good abstractions. The only boundary that works at design-time is a good abstraction. So ALA achieves it&#8217;s design-time boundaries by using abstractions.</p>

<p>It is said that TDD&#8217;s main advantage is not so much the testing, but the improvement in the design. In other words, making modules independently testable makes better abstractions. This is probably true, but in my experience, TDD doesn&#8217;t create good abstractions nearly as well as pursuing that goal directly. The architecture resulting from TDD is better but still not great.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the previous section we intimated that the sideways chains of interfaces going out in horizontal directions were the same as hexagonal architecture. While ALA shares this aspect of hexagonal architecture, there is still an important difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA retains domain abstractions of the UI, Database, communication and so on. For instance, in our XR5000 example, we had a domain abstraction for a persistent Table. We had domain abstractions for UI elements such as Page, Softkey etc. We don&#8217;t just have a port to the persistence adapter, we have an abstraction of persistence. We don&#8217;t just have a port for the UI to bind to, we have abstractions of the UI elements. The implementation of these abstractions will then use ports to connect to these external system components. Why is it important that we have domain abstractions of these external components?</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The Database and the UI will have a lot of application specific knowledge given them as configuration. Remember the creativity cycle. After instantiation of an abstraction comes configuration. The database will need a schema, and the knowledge for that schema is in the application. The Softkey UI elements will need labels, and that knowledge is in the application. By making domain abstractions for persistence and UI, the application can configure them like any other domain abstraction as it instantiates and wires up the application. To the application, these particular domain abstractions look like wrappers of the actual database and UI implementations, but they are more like proxies in that they just pass on the work.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Persistence abstraction then passes this configuration information, via the port interface to the actual database. The Softkey abstraction then passes its label, via the port interface, to the softkeys. Otherwise the Application would have to know about actual databases and actual softkeys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need a design where the UI can change, you just make the UI domain abstractions more abstract. A softkey may be a command abstraction. It is still configured with a label. But it may be connected to a softkey, a menu item, a CLI command, a web page button, or a Web API command.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the point of view of a DSL, it makes sense to have concepts of UI and persistence and communications in the DSL language. The application is cohesive knowledge of requirements. The UI and the need for persistence are part of the requirements. In fact, for product owners communicating requirements, the UI tends to be their view of requirements. They talk about them in terms of the UI. Many of the product owners I have worked with actually design the UI as part of the requirements (with the backing of their managers, who are easily convinced that software engineers can&#8217;t design UIs. PO can&#8217;t either, but that is another story.). The point here is that the UI layout, navigation, and connection to business logic is all highly cohesive. We explicitly do not want to separate that knowledge.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a restatement of an earlier tenet of ALA, it is much better to compose the application with abstractions of Business logic, UI and persistence than to decompose the application into UI, persistence and business logic.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want the application to have the property of composability. We have previously discussed how that means using programming paradigm interfaces for wiring up domain abstractions. By using domain abstractions to represent external components, the abstractions can implement the paradigm interfaces and then be composable with other domain abstractions. For example, the Table domain abstraction which represents persistence may need to be connected directly to a grid, or to other domain abstractions that map or reduce it. Indeed, the Table abstraction itself can be instantiated multiple times for different tables and be composed to form a schema using a schema programming paradigm interface. I have even had a table instance&#8217;s configuration interface wired to a another Table instance. (So its columns can be configured by the user of the application.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth reason why it is important for the application to not directly have ports for external components of the system is that we don&#8217;t want the logical view of the architecture to become just one part of the physical view. If there is a communications port that goes to a different physical machine where there is more application logic, the application&#8217;s logical view should not know about that. It may be presented as an annotation on the application (lines) connecting certain instances, but it shouldn&#8217;t split the application up. At the application level, the collaboration between parts instantiated on different machines is still cohesive knowledge and belongs inside one place - the application.</p>

<h3 id="truefactory-method-pattern"><a class="anchor" href="#truefactory-method-pattern"></a>7.6. Factory method pattern</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Factory Method pattern in both the GOF book and in online examples has multiple variations. The only thing they seem to have in common is that the client doesn&#8217;t use "new ConcreteProduct()". It just wants an object that implements an interface, IProduct. For any reason it doesn&#8217;t want to be the one who will decides at design-time what that concrete product will be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some of the variations.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Several ConcreteCreators exists to encapsulate knowledge of how to use the ConcreteProduct constructor which has many parameters, in a consistent way to make a valid ConcreteProduct. The common example is different named pizzas or sandwiches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Client finds out at run-time what ConcreteProduct is needed (usually a string name). We want to move the switch statement out of the client and into a Creator class.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client knows when the objects are needed, but needs to be more stable. Which product is needed changes more often (although still known at design-time). So it goes into a class that changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all cases we end up with two objects wired together through the IProduct interface. These two objects we will refer to as the Client and the ConcreteProduct (from the pattern terminology). To get them wired using the Factory Method pattern requires the use of a FactoryMethod. The FactoryMethod typically goes in an abstract class called ICreator, which may do the creating itself, or maybe overridden by one or more ConcreteCreators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the context of abstraction layers, ALA gives more insight into the FactoryMethods pattern. Remeber we expect lower layers to more stable. The IProduct and ICreator interfaces are in the ProgrammingParadigms layer (lowest layer). The Client and all the different ConcreteProducts are in the DomainAbstractions layer (middle layer). The ConcreteCreator is in the Application layer and wires one of the ConcreteProducts to the client. So now when we want to change the ConcreteProduct, only the ConcreteCreator in the application layer has to change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But in ALA we typically accomplish that in a far simpler way. We commonly let the application code instantiate the right concrete class (that implements the interface, IProduct), and wire it to the Client object using the WireTo() method. This is nothing more than static wiring, but can only work when the required ConcreteProduct is known at design-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="truecase-1"><a class="anchor" href="#truecase-1"></a>7.6.1. case 1</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now to the case in ALA where we have a client that needs a concrete product creating later than design-time, that is at run-time. Such a client is the Multiple Abstraction. It&#8217;s job is to make many instances of a Domain Abstraction. But it is an abstraction so can be used to make instances of any object. They don&#8217;t even have to implement a specific interface such as IProduct, because Multiple doesn&#8217;t interact with these instances itself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="truecase-2"><a class="anchor" href="#truecase-2"></a>7.6.2. case 2</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a Table domain abstraction that stores a table of data. In your application, you want to instantiate many Tables. Now lets suppose that we want these Table instances to persist their data. A database must be attached via an IPersistance interface. We don&#8217;t want the Table class to know about concrete Databases. We want the application layer at the top to do that. But we don&#8217;t want the application layer to have to wire the database to every instance that requires an IPersistance. We want the Application to be able to just use a Table as if it is a self-contained abstraction. We want the Table instances to take care of themselves for Persistence. So we make a Peristence abstraction in the Programming paradigms layer. The concept of Persistence is at the right abstraction level to go in this layer. The Table class can use this persistence abstraction through a FactoryMethod. A variable in the Persistence abstraction stores the IPeristence object. The application instantiates which database it wants to use and passes it to the Peristence abstraction.</p>

<p>The middle two layers appear to be the same as ALA&#8217;s. The Presentation (UI) only has run-time dependencies on the Application, and the Domain layer only has run-time dependencies on the Infrastructure (Persistence etc), so these layers are not present in ALA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead Presentation is done in the same way as the rest of the application, by composing and configuring abstractions in the domain. The meaning of composition for UI elements (typically layout and navigation-flow) is different from the meaning of composition in the use-cases (typically work-flow or data-flow).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, the foundation layer is also done in the same way as the rest of the application, at least a little. Domain abstractions that represent say a persistent table are in the Domain layer. The composition and configuration of them again goes in the Application layer. This time the meaning of composition is, for example, columns for the tables and schema relations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the implementation of any domain abstraction is not small (as is the case with the persistent Table abstraction mentioned above, which will need to be connected to a real database), it will be using other abstract interfaces (in the Programming Paradigms layer) connected to its runtime support abstractions in a technical domain, the same as in Hexagonal Architecture.</p>

<h4 id="trueobject-oriented-programming"><a class="anchor" href="#trueobject-oriented-programming"></a>7.10.3. Object Oriented Programming</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From my reading, it seems that the most characteristic feature of OOP is that when data and operations are cohesive, they are brought together in an object. Others may see it as enabling reuse, inheritance, and still others may see it as polymorphism. New graduates seem to be introduced to polymorphism in inheritance and not be introduced to interfaces at all, which is a shame because the concept of interfaces is much more important.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have never been an expert at Object Oriented Design as I found the choice of classes difficult and the resulting designs only mediocre. But I think the most fundamental and important characterising feature of OOP is under-rated. That is the separation of the concepts of classes and objects. This separation is not so clearly marked when we use the terms modules or components. The separation is fundamentally important because it&#8217;s what allows us to remove all dependencies except knowledge dependencies. In the way described earlier in this article, you can represent the knowledge of most dependencies as a relationship between instances completely inside another abstraction. What OOP should have done is represent relationships between objects completely inside another class. The problem is that OOP doesn&#8217;t take advantage of this opportunity. Instead, it puts these relationships between objects inside those objects' classes, as associations or inheritance, thereby turning them into design-time dependencies, and destroying the abstract qualities of the classes. Abstractions, unlike classes, retain their zero coupling with one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA addresses the problem by calling classes abstractions and objects instances. Abstractions differ from classes by giving us a way to have logical zero coupling, as if they were on different physical platforms. Instances differ from objects by having ports because their classes give them no fixed relationships with other objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, when you are writing ALA code, abstractions are implemented using classes, but you are not allowed associations or inheritance. Instances are implemented as objects but with ports for their connections. A port is a pair of interfaces that allow methods in both directions. The interfaces are defined in a lower layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, the UML class diagram completely loses relevance. Because classes have no relationships with each other, bar knowledge dependencies, a UML diagram in ALA would just be a lot of boxes in free space, like a pallet of things you can use. You could show them in their layers and you could even draw the downward composition relationships that represent the knowledge dependencies, but there would be no point to this except in explaining the concepts of ALA. When you are designing an actual system, the real diagram is the one inside of an abstraction, especially the uppermost one, the application. It shows boxes for instances of the abstractions it uses, with the name of the abstraction in the box, the configuration information for those instances, and of course the lines showing how they are wired together. The names inside the boxes would not even need to be underlined as in UML, because the boxes in such diagrams would always be instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such a diagram is close to a UML object diagram. However, a UML object diagram is meant to be a snapshot of a dynamic system at one point in time. In ALA, any dynamic behaviour is captured in a static way by inventing a new abstraction to describe that dynamic behaviour. Thus the design-time view is always static. So the object diagram is static. The application class specifies a number of objects that must be instantiated, configured, and wired together to execute at run-time. Since the structure is always static, ideally this would be done by the compiler for best efficiency, but there is no such language yet. So, in the meantime, it is done at initialization time. The object diagram can be fairly elegantly turned into code using the fluent coding style shown in the XR5000 example.</p>

<h3 id="truedsls-2"><a class="anchor" href="#truedsls-2"></a>7.11. DSLs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We briefly discussed ALA as a DSL in the structure chapter <a href="#DSL1">here</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA includes the main idea of DSLs in that the fundamental method "represent[s] requirements by composition of domain abstractions". It shares the DSL property that you can implement a lot more requirements or user stories in a lot less code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But ALA only tries to be a light-weight way of telling ordinary developers how to organise code written in your underlying language. Although the domain abstractions do form a language and the paradigm interfaces give it a grammar, ALA doesn&#8217;t pursue the idea of a language to the point of textural syntactic elegance. Instead, you end up with explicit wiring methods to combine domain entities, or plain old functional composition, or some other form of composition in the wider sense of the word. Often, the text form is only a result of hand translation of an executable diagram. ALA certainly doesn&#8217;t overlap with DSLs to the extent of an external DSL, nor does it try to sandbox you from the underlying language. It therefore does not require any parsing and doesn&#8217;t need a language workbench, things that may scare away 'plain old C' developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like DSLs, ALA can be highly declarative depending on the paradigm interfaces being used to connect domain abstractions. It is better to have the properties of composition and composability in the your domain language even if they may not be in a perfectly elegant syntactic form. ALA may end up composing abstractions with calls to wireTo methods instead of spaces or dots. But often a diagram using lines is even better than spaces and dots.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In DSLs, it is important that different languages can be combined for different aspects of a problem. For example, a DSL that defines State machines (the state diagram) and a DSL for data organisation (Entity Relationship Diagram) may be needed in the same application. You don&#8217;t want to be stuck in one paradigm. ALA recognises this importance by having paradigm interfaces that are more abstract than the domain abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DSLs probably work by generating a lot of code from templates whereas ALA works by reusing code as instances of abstractions. Both of these methods are fine from the point of view of keeping application specific knowledge in its place, and domain knowledge in its place. Howver, the distinction between ALAs domain layer and programming paradigms layer is probably not so as clearly made in the implementation of the templates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is an advantage of DSLs that they can sandbox when needed. An example from the wiring pattern earlier is that the ports of instances do not need to be wired. Therefore, all abstractions need to check if there is something wired to a port before making a call on it. Enforcing this is a problem I have not yet addressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A possible solution, albeit inferior to a real DSL that would tell you at design-time, might be that when there are tools that generate wiring code from diagrams, they automatically put stubs on all unwired ports. These stubs either throw an exception at run-time, or just behave inertly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA is different from external DSLs. ALA is just about helping programmers organise their code in a better way. It doesn&#8217;t try to make a syntactically elegant language, as a DSL does. Certainly an external DSL will end up representing requirements in a more elegant syntax. But that is not the most important thing in ALA. The most important thing is the separation of code that has knowledge of the requirements, which will cause the invention of abstractions that have zero coupling (because the coupling was really in each requirement - that is why a requirement is cohesive). ALA also avoids taking the average imperative language programmer out of their comfort zone. It does not require a language workbench and does not sandbox you from the underlying language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA probably does fit into the broadest definition of an internal DSL. However, again, it does not target syntactic convenience in the expression of requirements so much as just separating the code that knows about those requirements from the code that implements them. An internal DSL usually aims to have a mini-language that is a subset of the host language, or it tries to extend the host language through clever meta-programming to look as if it has new features. ALA is about abstraction layering. It is about this design-time view of knowledge dependencies: what abstractions in lower layers are needed to understand a given piece of code.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="truedifferences"><a class="anchor" href="#truedifferences"></a>7.12.2. Differences</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA uses explicit wiring, never automatic wiring. For one thing, the wiring is required to compose from a pallet of domain abstractions. But secondly, and more importantly, you do not want the knowledge that the wiring represents to disappear into the abstractions themselves, not even as meta-data. That would destroy the abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, the explicit wiring can&#8217;t be XML or JSON, even if it can be modified at run-time. Usually, because a network structure will be required, the explicit wiring must be a diagram. However, it can be a projection editor, so that the structure is entered in text form (preferably not XML or JSON) and live viewed in graphical form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, abstraction pairs don&#8217;t have their own interfaces for their instances to communicate. So we don&#8217;t have the situation where class A has a dependency on class B, and so an object of class B (or one of its subclasses) is injected into class A. Similarly, we wouldn&#8217;t have the situation where class A requires an interface that is implemented by class B.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA the dependencies can only be on paradigm interfaces, which are a whole abstraction layer more abstract. So we need to be thinking that if class A accepts or implements a certain paradigm interface, there could be any number of other abstraction instances that could be attached. Furthermore, we could build arbitrarily large assemblies - composability. Or we don&#8217;t have to connect an instance at all. So it doesn&#8217;t really make sense to call what we are injecting 'dependencies'. We just think of it as wiring things up, like electronic components.</p>

<h5 id="truedifferences-2"><a class="anchor" href="#truedifferences-2"></a>Differences</h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Component based engineering technologies such as CORBA primarily solve for platform and language interoperability in distributed system whereas ALA brings some of the resulting concepts and properties to everyday small-scale, non distributed development as well, where the only separation is logical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In ALA there is perhaps more particular emphasis on making components clearly more abstract than the systems they are used in, and making the interfaces clearly more abstract than the components. The components are pushed down a layer and the interfaces down to a layer below that. Then all dependencies must be strictly downwards in these layers. In component based engineering, this structure is not necessarily enforced. If the components are just a decomposition of the system, then the system, components and interfaces may all be at the same level of abstraction, making the system as a whole complex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA depends on the 'abstractness property' of components to get logical separation, and so calls them 'Abstractions' and not components to help them retain that property. Even if there will only be one use and one instance, it is still called an abstraction. This keeps them zero coupled and not collaborating with other abstractions they will be wired to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA layers are knowledge dependency layers.  Components may still be arranged in layers according to run-time dependencies, such as communication stacks. In ALA run-time dependencies are always implemented as explicit wiring inside another higher layer component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA&#8217;s top layer must be a straight representation of the requirements, whereas components may tend to be decomposed pieces of the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA&#8217;s 2nd layer of components are designed for expressiveness of user stories or requirements, and provide DSL-like properties. ALA puts emphasis on the 2nd layer of components having the scope of a domain as the means of explicitly controlling the expressiveness of the pallet of components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA is not fractal. In ALA the components of components are abstractions that become more abstract and thus ubiquitous and reusable. ALA therefore uses abstraction layers rather than hierarchies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA forces decisions about which abstraction layers the software artefacts go into, and then controls knowledge (semantic) dependencies accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA tries to make the abstraction layers discrete and separated by a good margin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA puts greater emphasis on wiring being able to represent any programming paradigm that suits the expression of requirements, and the use of many different paradigms in the same wiring diagram.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALA emphasises the cohesion of functional parts of a system such as UI, logic and Data, by bringing them all together in one small diagram using domain level components</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of 'required' interfaces, in ALA they are called 'accepts' interfaces. This is because the abstractions are more abstract and composable, so, as with Lego blocks, there isn&#8217;t necessarily a connection to another instance.</p>

<p>Methods such as ATAM tell us how to evaluate an architecture for quality attributes such as maintainability, for instance by giving it modification scenarios to test how difficult the modifications would be to implement. There are several scenarios based methods to do this such as ATAM. Using this we could, theoretically, iteratively search over the entire architecture design space to find a satisfactory solution. It&#8217;s a bit analogous to numerically solving for the maxima of a complex algebraic formula. In contrast, ALA is analogous to an 'algebraic solution'. If the desired quality attributes, and all the software engineering topics listed above are the equations, ALA is the algebraic solution. It simplifies them down into a parameterised template architecture, ready for you to go ahead and express your requirements.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="truemonads"><a class="anchor" href="#truemonads"></a>7.17. Monads</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have talked about monads a few times because they are an important example of composition of instances of abstractions. Also, like ALA, they use the concept of separating (in time) composition from execution. You can bind monads together, and it builds a structure that you can then execute. ALA is a generalisation of monads. In the same way, you can wire instances of domain abstractions together, and it builds a structure that you can later execute. In this respect they are similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you execute a monad structure (generally by calling a function on the last monad you binded), it (usually) terminates with its value (or values). It is only executes again if it is wired up again. An exception is when using hot observables, such as an IO monad. The monad structure stay in existence, and it executes whenever there is input or output. ALA is more similar to this second case. When you start execution of a wired ALA structure, it (usually) starts running continuously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each monad binding is restricted to a data-flow of a single type, and in a fixed direction. Each ALA wiring is arbitrary in its meaning, according to whatever is most useful to describe requirements. A single wired connection can carry data as needed in both, or the composition may be about something other than data-flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often when monads are used, the execution is done immediately following the binding. So the deferred nature of the execution is not always obvious.  I found that the separation between composition and execution of monads to be an important aspect to understand when comparing with ALA composition. In ALA all composition takes place at initialization time. There is a very clear separation between that and run-time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This much separation is not so common with monads. Monads use the separation primarily as a way to do composition with pure functions, and have all the dirty work contained and abstracted away in well tested reusable classes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where you might compose (bind) IObservable or Task monads for almost immediate execution following, in ALA you would tend to compose (wire up) data streams or event sources at initialization time that can then execute many-times thereafter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another difference is syntax. Monads are composed using a dot operator, a method call, and configured with lambda function passed to the method:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>source.Filter(x=&gt;x&gt;=0).Select(x=&gt;sqrt(x))</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This code filters out values from the source that are negative and then calculates the squareroots. In ALA, because composition is generalised, the syntax would look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>source.WireIn(new Filter(x=&gt;x&gt;=0)).WireIn(new Select(x=&gt;sqrt(x))</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But usually this code is generated from a diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In functional programming, the binding code that builds the structure is pure functions. When you ask the structure to 'execute' all the dirty code is contained inside these reusable abstractions called Monads. The code that constrauts a particular application is clean and free of side effects. ALA makes use of this same property of reuable abstractions, and its wiring code is pure functional.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Monads are notoriously hard to learn, but they are nice simple insight once you get there. Monads actually seem to have this property that you cannot understand any explanation of them until you first understand them. Thus it is a bootstrapping problem. Here is my experience of going through that bootstrapping process in case it is useful. I am not going to try to explain monads myself, because, even it was possible, others would do that far better than I would.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>First understand that Monads are like physics. Physicists explain that you never really understand physics, you just get used it. Unless you are a mathematician or otherwise gifted, the same is true for monads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way to get used to new concepts is to read multiple web-sites on the topic. Read each one until you get lost then swap to another one. Keep going like this. For average concepts like design patterns I use this technique and it requires maybe five websites. For monads it took me maybe ten. You will need to return to some of them iteratively to get further each time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know Haskell, prefer the web sites that explain them in the language you already know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The common essential ideas in those websites will start to embed themselves in your brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually, and fairly suddenly, the simple insight that is monads will happen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I thought few of the web-sites that I used adequately emphasised the monad property of separation (in time) of composition and execution. They did use examples of it such as IEnumerable and Task. They represent what they can do in the future, without actually doing it now. That&#8217;s why the binding functions are called bind in the functional world, because it doesn&#8217;t (necessarily) do anything except build a structure that can later be executed to actually do the work.</p>

<h3 id="truerecursive-abstractions"><a class="anchor" href="#truerecursive-abstractions"></a>8.1. Recursive abstractions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ALA enforces a strictly layered (non-circular) knowledge dependency structure. It encourages a small number of  abstraction layers at discrete well separated levels of ubiquity as a framework for the knowledge dependencies. This would appear to exclude the possibility of the powerful abstraction composition technique of recursion, where the meaning of an abstraction is defined in terms of itself. (Or an abstraction implementation may need knowledge of another abstraction, which in its turn has an implementation that needs knowledge of the first abstraction. This appears to require circular knowledge dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Circular knowledge dependencies happen all the time in functional programming where recursion replaces iteration. This is generally when a function needs to call itself or a class needs to use 'new' on itself. For example, a recursive descent compiler will have a function, 'statement', which will implement specific statements such as 'compound statement', 'if statement' and so on, and in those there will be a recursive call to the function, 'statement'. The following Syntax diagram represents part of the implementation of function 'statement'.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ALA, we want to preserve the idea of clear layers defining what knowledge is needed to understand what. Resolving this dilemma could get a bit philosophical. Since abstractions are the first class artefacts of the human brain, it may be best to think about how the brain does it. The brain must actually have two abstractions with the same name but at different levels. The first is analogous to a 'forward declaration' in a language to allow a compiler to know about something that will be referred to in a more abstract way before it finds out about it in a more specific way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By this analogy, ALA sometimes requires the concept of a forward-declared-abstraction, something that is clearly more abstract than the concrete implementations. Therefore, we can put this forward declaration in the next layer down, just as we would a paradigm interface. In the recursive descent compiler example, we would first have the abstract concept of a statement, meaning a unit of executable code as an interface in a lower layer. Then the specific abstractions, compound statement, if statement and so on are in a higher layer. They both provide and accept the interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another language example is that an expression is composed of terms, a term is composed of factors, and a factor can be composed of expressions (enclosed in round brackets). If we model these compositions as direct knowledge dependencies, we would have too many layers - and they would not be becoming more abstract as we go down. The existence of the recursion at the end reinforces that. It seems that all three, expressions, terms and factors, should have abstract interface versions at a lower level.</p>

<p>Not all cases of recursion would require these interfaces. If, for example, in your old way of doing things there is a long chain of function calls, with the last one calling the first one, all of them are probably run-time dependencies, not knowledge dependencies at all. So in ALA, they should all be changed to be wirable, and wired together by an abstraction in a higher layer. The paradigm interface that is used to allow them to be wired  may be,for example, data-flow. So recursion does not necessarily require different interfaces for each different abstraction involved in the circular dependency.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an advanced topic that allows abstractions to be written without knowing details of the implementation of the communications. The idea is for the language to support logical or abstracted I/O ports that work for any type of technical communication properties such as described in the sections below. If we allow these properties to be binded late, say at compile-time, they can be changed independently of the domain abstractions. This allows tuning of performance or physical deployment of the abstractions to different processes or hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have been looking into how this could be accomplished using a conventional language, but it seems quite hard.</p>

<h4 id="truepush-or-pull"><a class="anchor" href="#truepush-or-pull"></a>8.2.1. Push or Pull</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Say an abstraction has a single logical input that can be wired to and a single logical output that can be wired from. Both the input and the output could be used in either a push or a pull manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the input, push means we will be called with the data.  Pull means we will call out to get the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the output, push means we will call out with the data, and pull means that something will call us to get the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are four combinations possible:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>push push : push through</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pull pull : pull through</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>push pull : internally buffer the input or output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pull push : active object</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s imagine we have a function that processes the data inside the abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The four combinations would require the function to run as a result of a function call from the input, or a function call from the output. The function result may be put into an internal buffered or be pushed out. The function may need to receive its input from an input buffer or by pulling. The function may need to run via a 3rd input that is polled or called by a timer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could conceivably write an abstract I/O class with an output interface and an input interface and a configuration interface that allows it to be configured late on how to do the I/O. This abstract I/O object would call the function to do the work at the right time according to its configuration.</p>

<h3 id="trueworking-with-legacy-code"><a class="anchor" href="#trueworking-with-legacy-code"></a>8.3. Working with legacy code</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In old (non-ALA) legacy code, abstractions, if they ever existed, have usually been destroyed by coupling. If there is no model left by the original designer, or it is out of date, I first create one. I usually have to 'reverse engineer' the model by doing many 'all files searches' and trying to build a mental picture of how everything fits together. It can quickly become mentally taxing if the user story is non-trivial. So I build a UML class diagram from the searches (their one useful application) as the background (using light lines), and a tree of method calls for the specific user story on top of it (using heavier lines). These diagrams can end up looking pretty horrific, because the knowledge of the user-story has become so scattered, especially when inheritance is involved. The tree of method calls will come into the base class but leave from a subclass method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This process can take several hours to a day for a single user story.
Once the code for the single user story is understood, some acceptance tests are put in place for it, by putting in insertion points as close as practical to the inputs and outputs for the user story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next step is to factor out the method call tree for the user story into a new abstraction. This typically contains a sequence of new abstract activities or data transformations. These new abstractions are pitched at the domain level. Sometimes, if in C#, I will use Reactive Extensions. The user story may become a single RX sequence. The abstractions are then implemented, with tests, by copying and pasting useful code snippets from the original classes into the new abstractions. The old classes are marked for deprecation.</p>

<p>Conversion of user stories takes place iteratively.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because in ALA you can get multiple instances of the same class used in multiple places, and multiple implementations of the same interface used in different places, debugging is easier if the instances are able to identify themselves. For this reason I tend to have a local property in every class called Name. The property is immutable and set by the constructor.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of my first hobby programming projects was a compiler for a C-like high level language for embedded systems. At the time I had lots of energy to write the compiler and optimize the object code (written in itself, the performance of both compiling and of object code execution beat the first C compilers to later appear by around a factor of ten) but I lacked a lifetime of experience to design a language. Forty years later, I feel as if it&#8217;s partially the other way around, at least for language feature that would support good architecture. The language I should have implemented way back then should have been an ALA language - one that supported ALA architecture by having the needed constraints.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It would have had Abstractions and Instances as first class elements. The name Abstraction is to reinforce the obvious use of the only type of element that the brain uses at design-time for any kind of separation of concerns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It would support a single type of relationship - a knowledge dependency. You would have to define your four layers, and keep them in separate folders so you would be forced to decide at what abstraction level any given piece of design-time knowledge would go. Of course, it would only allow knowledge dependency relationships from one layer to a lower layer. If you wanted to add an extra layer to the chain of dependencies, that would be a bad design decision. For example, if your application is getting too large, you could create a layer between it and the domain abstractions layer called 'plug-ins'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instances would work like components in that they would have ports for I/O. Like interfaces, ports are defined in a lower layer. The only way of instantiating abstractions and connecting them together is inside an abstraction in a higher layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abstractions would support multiple ports of the same interface. Current languages have the difficulty that you can only implement one interface of a given type, which we had to workaround by having connector objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ports would support late configuration of all communication properties such as push, pull, asynchronous, synchronous (explained above) without changing the Abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such a language would overcome many of the problems of current languages that encourage non-ALA compliant practices. But the invention of good abstractions in the first sprint of any green-field project would still be a skilled phase requiring an innate ability to abstract.</p>
